Tracey		Holloway	Princeton	New Jersey	USA	teresah@Princeton.EDU	http://www.princeton.edu/~teresah/		http://www.princeton.edu/	Princeton University	I was searching to see if my homepage came up on an websearch one day, and came across your page.  Its a neat idea!  I wanted to let you know, however, that I'm listed 3 times, under various web aliases...  I'm the Teresa Ann Holloway of Providence, RI; the Teresa Holloway of New Jersey (tah@gfdl.gov); and the Tracey Holloway of Princeton, NJ.  As you guessed, my real name is Teresa, but I really only go by Tracey except on credit card bills.  I don't think I'm related to anyone on the page -- but since you happen to find all the Brown University and Princeton University Holloways (my undergrad and grad schools, respectivly), I do know a few of the others.	Okay, I've removed all the other entries.	Yes
