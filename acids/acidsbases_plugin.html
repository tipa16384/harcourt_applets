<H2>Acids and Bases</H2>
<P>In 1923, J.N. Bronstead and J.M. Lowry, working separately, proposed the definition that an acid is a substance
that can donate a proton to another substance, and a base is a substance that can accept a proton from another
substance. Strong acids would therefore increase the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution, and strong bases
would increase the hydroxide concentration of a solution. The measurement of pH is a simplified way to express
the hydrogen ion and hydroxide concentration of acids and bases. Using the pH scale, a solution with a pH of 7
is neutral, below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is basic. pH paper is one of the indicators used to measure the pH of
solution; the paper changes color for known pH ranges. The pH paper, however, only determines relative ranges;
a pH meter, an electronic instrument, is preferred for a more precise measurement of pH. This module simulates
the measurement of pH for acids and bases with pH paper as the indicator. The calculated numerical value of pH
is also displayed.

	<LI>Select an acid or base from the Acids &amp; Bases list.
	<PRE>HCl		hydrochloric acid		
HF		hydrofluoric acid		
HCN		hydrocyanic acid		
HNO<SUB>2</SUB>		nitrous acid		
HOC<SUB>6</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>		phenol			
HOAc		acetic acid				
NH<SUB>3</SUB>		ammonia			
NaOH		sodium hydroxide
(CH<SUB>3</SUB>)3N		trimethylamine
(CH<SUB>3</SUB>)2NH<SUB>2</SUB>	dimethylamine
(CH<SUB>3</SUB>)NH<SUB>2</SUB>	methylamine
C<SUB>6</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>NH<SUB>2</SUB>		aniline

</PRE>
	<LI>Enter the concentration of the acid or the base in the Concentration box.
	<LI>Click on the Dip button to measure the pH of the solution. Note: HOAc is a common shorthand symbolism for acetic
	acid, which has the formula HOOCCH<SUB>3</SUB>. The acetate ion, OAc<SUP>-</SUP>, is H<SUB>3</SUB>CCOO<SUP>-</SUP>.
