[Sat Dec 08 15:25:07 2001] You say, 'This afternoon, we will be going over some of the rules and procedures in guiding'
[Sat Dec 08 15:25:14 2001] Mawlen says, 'afternoon?'
[Sat Dec 08 15:25:21 2001] You say, 'After which you will be set free on the queue.'
[Sat Dec 08 15:25:23 2001] Sendark says, 'night here hehe'
[Sat Dec 08 15:25:24 2001] Espranza looks int the sky.
[Sat Dec 08 15:25:26 2001] It is 3 PM on Tuesday, the 24th day of January, of the year 3218.
[Sat Dec 08 15:25:26 2001] Earth Time: Sat Dec 08 15:25:26 2001
[Sat Dec 08 15:25:40 2001] Espranza looks at her watch... 3 PM...
[Sat Dec 08 15:25:49 2001] Mawlen has the same time.
[Sat Dec 08 15:25:54 2001] Espranza wonders why Sendark doesn't see the sun....
[Sat Dec 08 15:26:12 2001] Sendark thinks it must be time zones.
[Sat Dec 08 15:26:22 2001] Sathiss is also in the dark.
[Sat Dec 08 15:26:22 2001] You say, 'Oh, and just as an aside, we CAN tell the other guides here our home servers'
[Sat Dec 08 15:26:27 2001] You say, 'But nobody else.'
[Sat Dec 08 15:26:38 2001] Sendark says, 'Prexus'
[Sat Dec 08 15:26:38 2001] You say, 'Anyone else from EMarr?'
[Sat Dec 08 15:26:45 2001] Torgoth says, 'lanys!'
[Sat Dec 08 15:26:47 2001] Mawlen says, 'TP'
[Sat Dec 08 15:26:47 2001] Sathiss says, 'Vallon Zek, WOOT'
[Sat Dec 08 15:26:50 2001] Kilm says, 'Fennin ?'
[Sat Dec 08 15:26:53 2001] Sendark says, 'hehe'
[Sat Dec 08 15:26:57 2001] Sendark says, 'That opened the forum'
[Sat Dec 08 15:26:59 2001] Kilm says, 'Vallon, my first guide server !'
[Sat Dec 08 15:27:00 2001] You say, 'I have some chars on Fennin...'
[Sat Dec 08 15:27:20 2001] You say, 'Okay!'
[Sat Dec 08 15:27:23 2001] Sathiss says, 'I've only played on Vallon, and maybe 2 days on Sullon when released'
[Sat Dec 08 15:27:41 2001] Torgoth shivers at the thought of messing with Sathiss.
[Sat Dec 08 15:27:47 2001] You say, 'Although you are anon now, after you leave here, you won't be anon again'
[Sat Dec 08 15:27:55 2001] Espranza saved.
[Sat Dec 08 15:27:58 2001] Mawlen nods at Espranza.
[Sat Dec 08 15:28:00 2001] Sendark agrees with Espranza.
[Sat Dec 08 15:28:14 2001] Sendark glances at the P & P.
[Sat Dec 08 15:28:14 2001] Sathiss makes a mental note of that.
[Sat Dec 08 15:28:21 2001] You say, 'Our number one job here is to be available to the players,'
[Sat Dec 08 15:28:48 2001] You say, 'and if they can't see us in /who gm all, they may feel abandoned, lonely, bereft of the CS we so desperately want to provide'
[Sat Dec 08 15:28:52 2001] Disden GMSAYS, 'lirus what are telling the IC people, that they are screwed until futher notice?'
[Sat Dec 08 15:28:54 2001] Mawlen still has to print the P&P to big to open on computer with printer.
[Sat Dec 08 15:29:18 2001] Espranza can send Mawlen a version of the P&P in .RTF format, which can be opened with Wordpad.
[Sat Dec 08 15:29:29 2001] Mawlen would appreciate that.
[Sat Dec 08 15:29:46 2001] Torgoth gnaws on a monitor.
[Sat Dec 08 15:29:54 2001] You say, 'Please write down your questions - or Torgoth, tie a string around your toe - and I will ask for them at significant pauses'
[Sat Dec 08 15:30:04 2001] Mawlen says, 'lol'
[Sat Dec 08 15:30:06 2001] Espranza pauses, but not significantly.
[Sat Dec 08 15:30:07 2001] Sendark wonders where the seinor guide is. Not that he doesn't like Espranza or anything, he's just curious.
[Sat Dec 08 15:30:17 2001] Torgoth says, 'hehe'
[Sat Dec 08 15:30:24 2001] You say, 'That was.... a question....'
[Sat Dec 08 15:30:31 2001] Sendark nods at Espranza.
[Sat Dec 08 15:30:36 2001] You say, 'Well, it's like this... NONE of the senior guides are halflings.'
[Sat Dec 08 15:30:43 2001] The spirit leaves you.
[Sat Dec 08 15:30:44 2001] You say, 'I think that explains it well enough.'
[Sat Dec 08 15:30:46 2001] Mawlen says, 'i want disden to be here'
[Sat Dec 08 15:30:51 2001] Sendark says, 'hehe okies'
[Sat Dec 08 15:30:52 2001] Mawlen giggles at Disden.
[Sat Dec 08 15:31:13 2001] You say, 'The senior guides are Kezia, Lancet, Rynara and Mersi. Our server GM is Lirus.'
[Sat Dec 08 15:31:24 2001] You say, 'Together they make up the Server Management Team, or SMT.'
[Sat Dec 08 15:31:46 2001] You say, 'If you need to talk to the SMT, you can find them at MorellThuleSeniors@yahoogroups.com'
[Sat Dec 08 15:32:13 2001] You say, 'If you need to talk to Lirus directly, you can send her email at msudnik@soe.sony.com'
[Sat Dec 08 15:32:35 2001] You say, 'That address is not for use by players, players should be asked to use the Contact Your GM link on everquestlive.com'
[Sat Dec 08 15:32:55 2001] You say, 'I say 'her' even though Lirus is a barbie male, because his player is a her'
[Sat Dec 08 15:33:30 2001] You say, 'I am sure that you have read the P&P (even if you have not printed it out), as well as your apprentice guidelines.'
[Sat Dec 08 15:33:42 2001] Torgoth nods.
[Sat Dec 08 15:33:46 2001] Sendark nods at Espranza.
[Sat Dec 08 15:33:46 2001] You say, 'please take them very seriously. These documents comprise the Word from Above.'
[Sat Dec 08 15:33:58 2001] Disden GMSAYS, 'ahh everyone with cool zone messages well err...ZONE!!!'
[Sat Dec 08 15:34:36 2001] You say, 'Your P&P and other docs cover nearly every situation that will arise while guiding - and so if you come across a situation you have not encountered before, try to find the answer in the P&P before asking for help.'
[Sat Dec 08 15:34:48 2001] You say, 'On the other hand, never hesitate to ask for help! We LOVE question.'
[Sat Dec 08 15:34:52 2001] You say, 's/'
[Sat Dec 08 15:34:57 2001] Espranza growls.
[Sat Dec 08 15:35:00 2001] You say, 'QUESTIONS.'
[Sat Dec 08 15:35:11 2001] Sendark giggles at Espranza.
[Sat Dec 08 15:35:15 2001] You sigh, clearly disappointed.
[Sat Dec 08 15:35:31 2001] You say, 'I cannot stress enough the tenets in the Apprentice Guidelines...'
[Sat Dec 08 15:35:35 2001] You say, 'Always be polite!'
[Sat Dec 08 15:35:41 2001] You say, 'Never ignore a petition!'
[Sat Dec 08 15:35:47 2001] Espranza mentally adds "from a halfling"!
[Sat Dec 08 15:35:58 2001] You say, 'Never respond to /ooc's or /shout's'
[Sat Dec 08 15:35:58 2001] Calgire tells you, 'Hi can I tell ya something'
[Sat Dec 08 15:36:09 2001] Calgire tells you, '?'
[Sat Dec 08 15:36:10 2001] You told Calgire, 'sure... best if you petitioned though'
[Sat Dec 08 15:36:17 2001] You say, 'Roleplay whenever possible'
[Sat Dec 08 15:36:32 2001] Calgire tells you, 'Yeah but I petitioned earlier this'll just be real fast'
[Sat Dec 08 15:36:35 2001] You say, 'And track the things you learn in a notebook, which you should keep near you always while guiding'
[Sat Dec 08 15:36:43 2001] Sathiss loves roleplaying.
[Sat Dec 08 15:37:12 2001] You say, 'You came into cshome today with the two best guide tools - your game knowledge and your common sense.'
[Sat Dec 08 15:37:35 2001] You say, 'We also graciously provide you with two new commands to use, /pr (for the CS chat channel), and'
[Sat Dec 08 15:37:35 2001] Calgire tells you, 'That new system rocks. The one where if your getting attacked and you go LD it moves you to a safe spot...that rocks! :-)'
[Sat Dec 08 15:37:50 2001] You told Calgire, 'it doesn't always happen that way....'
[Sat Dec 08 15:38:00 2001] Calgire tells you, 'Howcome it happened to me?'
[Sat Dec 08 15:38:04 2001] Espranza saved.
[Sat Dec 08 15:38:09 2001] You say, '/searchcorpse (or /sea) which finds people's corpses.'
[Sat Dec 08 15:38:22 2001] You told Calgire, 'just luck most likely - though of course I'm glad it saved you!'
[Sat Dec 08 15:38:31 2001] Calgire tells you, 'Hehe me too :-)!'
[Sat Dec 08 15:38:33 2001] Mawlen has a question )

[Sat Dec 08 15:38:47 2001] Lirus GMSAYS, 'crashed in Wakening'
[Sat Dec 08 15:38:52 2001] Espranza pauses to glare at Mawlen... but significantly, it is not a significan pause.
[Sat Dec 08 15:39:02 2001] Lirus GMSAYS, 'any cali goers feel that little earthquake btw?'
[Sat Dec 08 15:39:02 2001] Mawlen says, 'can i ask it?'

[Sat Dec 08 16:13:25 2001] Sendark says, 'ask again!'
[Sat Dec 08 16:13:37 2001] Kilm says, 'Use shift-Up arrow and ask again, sometime we miss the questions while zoneing'

[Sat Dec 08 16:16:49 2001] Kilm says, 'Even if this means changing your hunting schedule for the night '
[Sat Dec 08 16:17:06 2001] Kilm says, 'Staying in the zone can be viewed as a guide leak '
[Sat Dec 08 16:17:53 2001] Kilm says, 'Participating or telling your friends abiout the quest is a guide leak and be subject to investigation and possible removal from the program '

[Sat Dec 08 16:20:43 2001] You say, 'Reprimanding guides is what seniors do :)'
[Sat Dec 08 16:20:56 2001] Kilm tells the group, 'my script doesn't say that :( '
