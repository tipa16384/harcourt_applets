Before the curse of Zek, the ogres were the strongest of the gods' creations upon Norrath. I am a product of our greatest years of glory, and it was then that I [ascended] to take my place within the Realm of Heroes. I am sure that my lack of third person speech had you a bit confused as to my origins. 
[Wed Apr 11 20:15:02 2001] You say, 'why have you ascended'
[Wed Apr 11 20:15:02 2001] Kizrak the Tyrant says 'I led a mighty army for several decades serving the powers of war. My deeds were recognized by The Warlord himself, and in return for my strengthening of his name in battle, I was chosen to walk the Realm of Heroes. Now, I find that I have returned to a nation of slobbering buffoons who have allied with the Teir`Dal of all creatures. It is almost painful to be subjected to the witnessing of it, but, as The [Warlord commands], it shall be done.
