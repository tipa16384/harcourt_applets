[Sun Feb 03 18:07:16 2002] Lilpokey tells you, 'great, is it all illusions or just certain masks ?'
[Sun Feb 03 18:07:56 2002] You told Lilpokey, 'all illusions. The enchanters aren't too happy with it either :) actually, you still get the effects of the illusion (like faction changes, regen or whatever), just not the appearance.'
[Sun Feb 03 18:08:11 2002] Lilpokey tells you, 'aye i noticed that earlier'

[Sun Feb 03 18:11:56 2002] Antarg tells the guild, 'well go ahead and nerf it, I must have misread the name policy'
[Sun Feb 03 18:12:12 2002] You say to your guild, 'it's in the P&P, the rules concerning guide names.'
[Sun Feb 03 18:12:19 2002] Lirus tells the guild, 'i have been letting em keep it cause it's not harmful or hateful in any way'
[Sun Feb 03 18:12:30 2002] Rimedear GMSAYS, 'It refers to alcohol, which is a first class name violation'
[Sun Feb 03 18:12:31 2002] Lirus tells the guild, 'in the naming policy it says'
[Sun Feb 03 18:13:02 2002] Antarg tells the guild, 'I thought the naming policy refered directly to the names being identical to CS personal in regards to impersonation'
[Sun Feb 03 18:13:26 2002] Lirus tells the guild, 'names chosen with the "intent" or possessed with the effect of "harming" the reputation or a player or CS rep'

[Sun Feb 03 18:14:24 2002] You say to your guild, 'people have asked for Espranza as their last name, esp. after I nerf it.'
[Sun Feb 03 18:14:43 2002] You GMSAY, 'I talked with Lirus about it before I changed it'
[Sun Feb 03 18:14:52 2002] Lirus tells the guild, 'hehe'
[Sun Feb 03 18:14:59 2002] Antarg tells the guild, 'I take it "Son of Lirus" is out of the question also?'
[Sun Feb 03 18:15:02 2002] Rimedear GMSAYS, 'so no go then, okay.'
[Sun Feb 03 18:15:02 2002] Lirus GMSAYS, 'the brew ski guy?'
[Sun Feb 03 18:15:09 2002] Rimedear GMSAYS, 'Yes'
[Sun Feb 03 18:15:11 2002] You GMSAY, 'if he wants to complain about it, eqcs@soe.sony.com'

[Sun Feb 03 18:15:31 2002] Espranza saved.
[Sun Feb 03 18:15:38 2002] Lirus tells the guild, 'for you it would be fine antarg'
[Sun Feb 03 18:15:44 2002] You say to your guild, 'If Lirus says the name is okay with her'
[Sun Feb 03 18:15:49 2002] You say to your guild, 'which I guess she has...'
[Sun Feb 03 18:16:00 2002] Antarg tells the guild, 'lol, that would be fun :)'
[Sun Feb 03 18:16:01 2002] Lirus tells the guild, 'the name Lirusbait is really an ok name as far as policy goes, if it starts getting bad i'll take em...like Xazy's names'
[Sun Feb 03 18:16:31 2002] You say to your guild, 'Well, it's up to you, Lirus. It's your name their rapping on.'
[Sun Feb 03 18:16:47 2002] You have changed Antarg's last name to Son of Lirus.
[Sun Feb 03 18:16:55 2002] Lirus tells the guild, 'the only reason they do it is to be cute and they do like me. I am kinda flattered actually'
[Sun Feb 03 18:17:19 2002] Lirus tells the guild, 'i have smacked rulu hard enough in the past she finally got one she likes and that actually is ok by policy'
[Sun Feb 03 18:17:23 2002] Antarg tells you, 'sorry esp, I dun really want to make you feel victumized, I know I would feel like that in your position'

[Sun Feb 03 18:17:39 2002] You told Antarg, 'I don't want to put you on the spot, especially since Lirus gave you that name'
[Sun Feb 03 18:17:57 2002] Antarg tells you, 'I dont really mind, it's a surname'
[Sun Feb 03 18:18:02 2002] You told Antarg, 'but I have been having a lot of people with names intended to "bait" Lirus etc'
[Sun Feb 03 18:18:12 2002] Rimedear GMSAYS, 'That may be the case, but alcohol as used in the game is not the same as having a name which represents a modern (non-fantasy) slang version of beer'
[Sun Feb 03 18:18:22 2002] You told Antarg, 'I would prefer personally that we stay in the background of the game here.'
[Sun Feb 03 18:18:30 2002] Antarg tells you, 'I agree'
[Sun Feb 03 18:18:40 2002] Lirus GMSAYS, 'the issue is that the name which was a "real word" was separated by the firstname /surname combination'
[Sun Feb 03 18:18:46 2002] USER TEXT: when are the rogue mask's gonna work again ?
[Sun Feb 03 18:18:51 2002] Antarg tells you, 'thinking about it now, sharing a surname with a player could be constrewed as favoritism'
[Sun Feb 03 18:18:52 2002] DELETING THIS PETITION
[Sun Feb 03 18:18:53 2002] Lirus GMSAYS, 'the surname Brewski is not neccesarily a bad name'

[Sun Feb 03 18:19:04 2002] Rimedear GMSAYS, 'Oh damn, I meant to send him that... now I have to type it again'
[Sun Feb 03 18:19:16 2002] You GMSAY, 'shift-up arrow and edit it'
[Sun Feb 03 18:19:46 2002] You told Antarg, 'and I feel could make people think including guide and GM names in their surnames is a fun game, like for example Xazy thinks.'
[Sun Feb 03 18:20:04 2002] Antarg tells you, 'Xazy is a nutcase :)'
[Sun Feb 03 18:20:29 2002] You told Antarg, 'Xazy was amusing at first, but now thinks he is every guide's favorite player and is beginning to think he should get special treatment.'
[Sun Feb 03 18:20:46 2002] You told Antarg, 'People like Xazy are precisely why we shouldn't get too friendly with the players.'
[Sun Feb 03 18:20:56 2002] Antarg tells you, 'I agree'
[Sun Feb 03 18:21:17 2002] Rimedear GMSAYS, 'so can he get a first name change too? '
