She was able to control the rain which fell from the heavens and would call upon the spirits to aide her. It was obvious that Amstaf took a liking to Ambreen. She ended up coming along with us on our crusades. The last that I saw of Ambreen was when we went to the snow covered lands of Everfrost. We were wandering the lands when a freak [snowstorm] hit us. We were separated from one another for quite some time.

[Thu Jun 14 22:37:03 2001] Kanthuk Ogrebane says 'As I laid there my body began to slowly freeze. I knew death was near and accepted the inevitable. Suddenly I felt something clutching at my cloak. I was being dragged upwards out of the snow. A hand pressed against my chest and began to glow. I felt energy pass into my body. Do you know [how] he had saved me?

We knew that we didn't have much time left to bring life back to her body. However, the storm didn't pass through and we knew we couldn't venture to far without the fear of freezing. I warmed the cabin and rested for some time thinking about what we were going to do. It wasn't long before my exhaustion took over. I fell into a deep [slumber] that night.
