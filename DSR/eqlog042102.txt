[Sun Apr 21 09:20:43 2002] Rynara says, 'lancet any luck?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:20:47 2002] Lancet tells the group, 'gm coming'
[Sun Apr 21 09:20:56 2002] Ashnazg raises his hand.
[Sun Apr 21 09:21:01 2002] Kedian says, 'just a minor concern...'
[Sun Apr 21 09:21:02 2002] Lancet says, 'a gm will be here for buffs'
[Sun Apr 21 09:21:06 2002] You say, 'Ashnazhgdhjdj?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:21:09 2002] Ashnazg woots.
[Sun Apr 21 09:21:12 2002] Faelinn laughs.
[Sun Apr 21 09:21:38 2002] Espranza saved.
[Sun Apr 21 09:21:38 2002] Ashnazg says, 'Were there a lot of freaks here before I came, or did they follow me over from Mith Mar?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:21:49 2002] You say, 'They were here waiting for you. Next?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:21:50 2002] Kedian says, '...in about the last 3 or 4 shifts, I haven't seen any apprentices around.  And only 1 is here at the meeting.  I'd like to reaffirm that apprentices are allways welcome here.'
[Sun Apr 21 09:21:51 2002] Faelinn says, 'Nah weve always been here'
[Sun Apr 21 09:21:53 2002] Rynara says, 'they followed you, thanks alot!'
[Sun Apr 21 09:22:00 2002] Lancet says, 'not here you contaminate the server'
[Sun Apr 21 09:22:09 2002] Ashnazg feels bad.
[Sun Apr 21 09:22:10 2002] You say, 'The apprentices are all working on my summer home at the moment. Next?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:22:13 2002] Ashnazg is a bad lizard.
[Sun Apr 21 09:22:19 2002] Kedian laughs.
[Sun Apr 21 09:22:24 2002] Aryante says, 'Hail, Lancet'
[Sun Apr 21 09:22:26 2002] Lancet tells the group, 'did you announce sivy for qc?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:22:28 2002] Dalios mutters about pots and pans.
[Sun Apr 21 09:22:31 2002] Aryante says, 'when do we get a summer home?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:22:43 2002] Rynara says, 'we will have some new victims err appies next week'
[Sun Apr 21 09:22:45 2002] You say, 'You can't even keep MINE clean, and you ask that. Next?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:22:53 2002] Lancet says, 'lol you have a pool what more you want'
[Sun Apr 21 09:23:04 2002] Ashnazg thinks he is in his summer home.
[Sun Apr 21 09:23:06 2002] You tell your party, 'no, haven't announced that'
[Sun Apr 21 09:23:15 2002] Rynara tells the group, 'no DONT'
[Sun Apr 21 09:23:25 2002] Aryante forgot she was supposed to be cleaning Espranza's home, but then Ary has been forgetting lots of stuff lately.
[Sun Apr 21 09:23:35 2002] Rynara tells the group, 'I would rather email them first then post'
[Sun Apr 21 09:23:44 2002] Lancet tells the group, 'ok'
[Sun Apr 21 09:23:48 2002] Rodetta says, 'light hearted and soft minded'
[Sun Apr 21 09:23:56 2002] You snicker softly at Lancet.
[Sun Apr 21 09:23:59 2002] You no longer have a target.
[Sun Apr 21 09:23:59 2002] Ashnazg growls at Rodetta.
[Sun Apr 21 09:24:05 2002] Rynara says, 'I want a grill by the pool'
[Sun Apr 21 09:24:07 2002] Lancet says, 'ok its slam your senior time what can we be  doing to help you all more'
[Sun Apr 21 09:24:20 2002] Ashnazg says, 'Give us summer homes.'
[Sun Apr 21 09:24:22 2002] Rynara tells the group, 'lancet..... shut up lol'
[Sun Apr 21 09:24:28 2002] Lancet tells the group, 'hehe'
[Sun Apr 21 09:24:37 2002] Rynara starts making a list.
[Sun Apr 21 09:24:40 2002] Faelinn raises her hand.
[Sun Apr 21 09:24:40 2002] Aryante says, 'well, speaking of house cleaning, my could use a little work. How long would it take you to get to Germany?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:24:41 2002] Kilm raises his hand 
[Sun Apr 21 09:24:42 2002] Lancet tells the group, 'want to see if caz opens her mouth'
[Sun Apr 21 09:25:02 2002] Aelenor says, 'well ary not more than 3 hours :)'
[Sun Apr 21 09:25:03 2002] You say, 'The nearest port is France. And who would want to go to France? Next!'
[Sun Apr 21 09:25:07 2002] Ashnazg raises a ham. Closest thing to a sow he has.
[Sun Apr 21 09:25:24 2002] Lancet tells the group, 'anyone have any concerns about anything doing with the guide program'
[Sun Apr 21 09:25:34 2002] You tell your party, 'yeah, when do we get paid'
[Sun Apr 21 09:25:43 2002] Ashnazg is a ham, for that matter.
[Sun Apr 21 09:25:51 2002] Dalios says, 'Do you Seniors get a discount at theatres and diners?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:25:56 2002] Lancet says, 'wow a bunch of happy campers '

[Sun Apr 21 09:26:06 2002] Nazbag says, 'kilm or faelinn...babble!'
[Sun Apr 21 09:26:06 2002] Rynara says, 'Kilm have a question?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:26:06 2002] Ashnazg is a happy resort goer.
[Sun Apr 21 09:26:11 2002] Archeilus says, 'actually I am camping Lirus ... long spawn time'
[Sun Apr 21 09:26:11 2002] Rodetta says, 'what could we possibly complain about?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:26:19 2002] Lancet says, 'rofl'
[Sun Apr 21 09:26:25 2002] Aryante tries to think of something serious to say, but can't because her seniors are the best, (especially after seeing certain other servers SMTs)
[Sun Apr 21 09:26:42 2002] You blush profusely.
[Sun Apr 21 09:26:44 2002] Ashnazg makes a list. There's plenty to complain about.... but not much that's really a problem. :)
[Sun Apr 21 09:26:59 2002] Kedian says, '/agree Aryante'
[Sun Apr 21 09:27:05 2002] Aelenor agrees with Ashnazg.
[Sun Apr 21 09:27:06 2002] Ashnazg liked his last SMT.
[Sun Apr 21 09:27:10 2002] Lancet says, 'do we need more meetings or once a month or 2 working fine?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:27:13 2002] Ashnazg didn't like the freaks.
[Sun Apr 21 09:27:21 2002] Savlyn complains that his green sleeves no longer show up.
[Sun Apr 21 09:27:24 2002] Faelinn says, 'I think you guys are doing a great job, and asd ive already over mentuioned i really appreciate the level of understanding ive got regarding my situation in the last month and that I appreciate more then you know. '
[Sun Apr 21 09:27:28 2002] Faelinn says, 'K im done next :)'
[Sun Apr 21 09:27:36 2002] Tarlof says, 'an occasional pop in in the mornings on here might not be bad...  (i get 1 in 15 petitions on average asking for namechanges from people overseas who cant really be on during prime hours)'
[Sun Apr 21 09:27:44 2002] Dalios has something to say!
[Sun Apr 21 09:27:46 2002] Archeilus says, 'Aye, same here Tarlof'
[Sun Apr 21 09:27:50 2002] You say, 'Dalios?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:27:57 2002] Ashnazg wants something else to eat besides gnomes. Needs more dwarf and barbarian in his diet.
[Sun Apr 21 09:28:10 2002] Lancet says, 'wish i could but i work from 7am till 5 pm m-f'
[Sun Apr 21 09:28:12 2002] Rynara says, 'I managed to do a few this morning'
[Sun Apr 21 09:28:12 2002] Archeilus says, 'be nice if Guides could do surname changes '
[Sun Apr 21 09:28:21 2002] You say, 'I'll do what I can, but I, too, work in the mornings.'
[Sun Apr 21 09:28:22 2002] Tarlof says, 'there's a good reason we cant'
[Sun Apr 21 09:28:30 2002] Dalios says, 'The Guides I've mentored under have been great. Nothing like logging in and getting offered a group almost instantly.. All have been helpful and informative.. '
[Sun Apr 21 09:28:31 2002] Faelinn says, 'Yes Tarlof is right'
[Sun Apr 21 09:28:33 2002] Archeilus says, 'always a good reason ;)'
[Sun Apr 21 09:28:37 2002] Rynara says, 'LOveforyou was not a happy camper'
[Sun Apr 21 09:28:51 2002] Ashnazg says, 'I saw that reason, but they could make a different level of name change power, not necessarily a different level of guide.'
[Sun Apr 21 09:28:55 2002] Archeilus says, 'difference in name and surname changes though'
[Sun Apr 21 09:29:02 2002] Dalios says, '(Now if only my play characters could get groups this quick..heh..)'
[Sun Apr 21 09:29:06 2002] Archeilus says, 'maybe after a certain level /shrugs'
[Sun Apr 21 09:29:13 2002] You say, 'That has been discusses....'
[Sun Apr 21 09:29:20 2002] Archeilus says, 'that is true too'
[Sun Apr 21 09:29:29 2002] Lancet says, 'you are not the first to ask that it has been asked many times they wont buy it'
[Sun Apr 21 09:29:32 2002] Ashnazg says, 'If we can do name changes with player approval, so we illiminate the surname they don't want if they approve it.'
[Sun Apr 21 09:29:34 2002] You say, 'The policy team has said before that they will look into giving guides certain name powers'
[Sun Apr 21 09:29:45 2002] You say, 'But who knows what will come of that'

[Sun Apr 21 09:30:03 2002] Archeilus says, 'I think guides should be on the policy team ;) its in our union contract right?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:30:09 2002] Ashnazg says, 'Its not like its an awesome power, like world kicking.'
[Sun Apr 21 09:30:09 2002] You say, 'Rodetta?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:30:14 2002] Faelinn says, 'No only stewards'
[Sun Apr 21 09:30:24 2002] Rodetta says, 'Anything about the global chat channels yet?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:30:34 2002] You say, 'You'll know when we do, most likely'
[Sun Apr 21 09:30:42 2002] Lancet says, 'there is no need for a guide to use one'

[Sun Apr 21 09:31:10 2002] Rodetta says, 'i just want em for late night AC's. no hurry'
[Sun Apr 21 09:31:10 2002] Aryante says, 'we aren't supposed to be in the global chat channels, so what if we have some that automatically come on when we log in. Do we get in trouble even if we turn them off really ffast?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:31:14 2002] Archeilus says, 'they need to fix that autojoin then ;)'
[Sun Apr 21 09:31:23 2002] Faelinn says, 'Im not arguing that at all I just didnt know, I must have missed that post'
[Sun Apr 21 09:31:28 2002] You say, 'You don't get in trouble for that, Ary :) just don't speak in them'
[Sun Apr 21 09:31:32 2002] Tarlof says, 'namechanging is a big power ash..  with 1 command you can take a little of the identity that people know someone by and erase it...  '
[Sun Apr 21 09:31:34 2002] Ashnazg says, 'Only reason I can think of is for an answer circle, but that kind of global access would get out of hand really fast.'
[Sun Apr 21 09:31:37 2002] Nazbag says, 'I got a petition to join on lance, about language'
[Sun Apr 21 09:31:48 2002] You say, 'We don't police chat channels'

[Sun Apr 21 09:32:05 2002] Lancet says, 'that would be the same as grouping which we cant do'
[Sun Apr 21 09:32:10 2002] You say, 'They are private, like tells.'
[Sun Apr 21 09:32:16 2002] You say, 'We don't police tells either.'
[Sun Apr 21 09:32:17 2002] Tarlof says, 'players police their own channels..  that's what moderator commands are for'
[Sun Apr 21 09:32:22 2002] Nazbag says, 'we police OOC, shout, say, and even Gsay and Tells if they /report'
[Sun Apr 21 09:32:37 2002] Faelinn says, 'I read in a post ofpolicy change that we are indeed permitted to group with people during a wedding... Is this true?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:32:38 2002] You say, 'We advise the /ignore command for tells.'
[Sun Apr 21 09:32:41 2002] Aryante says, 'ok, the hot wings are done. Looks like there are enough for one each. Shall I start squishing them through the modem to you?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:32:45 2002] You say, 'Yes, Faelinn, this is true.'
[Sun Apr 21 09:32:56 2002] Faelinn says, 'Ok'
[Sun Apr 21 09:33:03 2002] Rynara says, 'the question has been asked of the policy team. Last I heard they were discussing it and until its settled guides are to stay off the channels'
[Sun Apr 21 09:33:10 2002] Kedian says, 'in the case of private messages, we are not doing the policing, but the GM who pulls the report is.'
[Sun Apr 21 09:33:29 2002] Lancet says, 'we are still waiting on a rework of zones we cant go till them  list is still as is'
[Sun Apr 21 09:33:45 2002] Nazbag says, 'not when you get the /report pulled by a chat GM kedian'
[Sun Apr 21 09:34:39 2002] Kedian says, 'most chat GMs wont tell me what they said, but they will say 'warn them for blah blah blah'.  To me, that means they made the decision, im just the messenger'
[Sun Apr 21 09:34:48 2002] Aryante says, 'a global chat for answer circles would be nice, but we can live without it.'
[Sun Apr 21 09:34:59 2002] You say, 'answer circles are done through /say'
[Sun Apr 21 09:35:13 2002] Lancet says, 'i hope not then i would have to learn how to use them'
[Sun Apr 21 09:35:30 2002] Aelenor agrees with Lancet.
[Sun Apr 21 09:35:33 2002] Cerifan tells none:1, 'morning :)'

[Sun Apr 21 09:35:42 2002] Savlyn uses his mental telepathy.
[Sun Apr 21 09:35:46 2002] You are not on any channels
[Sun Apr 21 09:36:02 2002] Nazbag says, 'can we get the DSR forum archived more often?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:36:07 2002] Aryante thinks the hot wings are really hot tonight. Son took one bite and is dashing around the room like a mad man.
[Sun Apr 21 09:36:12 2002] Lancet says, 'hell i just learned where the meditate button was and they took that away'
[Sun Apr 21 09:36:14 2002] Nazbag says, 'it takes longer to load that page than it does to file the DSR'
[Sun Apr 21 09:36:23 2002] You say, 'that's true...!'
[Sun Apr 21 09:36:33 2002] Rynara says, 'PaulZ was asked this, he has not responded to it yet'
[Sun Apr 21 09:36:53 2002] Rynara says, 'many people are complaining about it'
[Sun Apr 21 09:36:54 2002] Tarlof says, 'it's something not to erase  but keep it available..  as the old DSR's are a wealth of information'
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:04 2002] You say, 'Here's a question about chat channels for you knowledgable people'
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:07 2002] Lancet says, 'im trying to get support to get old boards back  but that will never happen'
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:07 2002] Tarlof says, 'but need it available in a way not to slow the board down'
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:15 2002] You say, 'How do you autojoin NO channels?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:25 2002] Faelinn says, 'turn autojoin off'
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:26 2002] Tarlof says, 'i put a post on common hall on that lancet'
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:29 2002] Kedian says, 'remove the chatautojoin line in your eqclient.ini'
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:43 2002] You say, 'oh cool, thanks Ked:)'
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:50 2002] Aelenor says, 'is it possible to wish for more Swat people on during this timeframe .. lots of pets gets kinda lost since bugs and such happends on Euro primetime but no GMs are awalible?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:51 2002] Faelinn says, 'type /autojoin off'
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:52 2002] Lancet says, 'lol i did the senior board got laughed at'
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:55 2002] Savlyn says, 'tell the server dont make and stinkin chat channels?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:57 2002] Set channels to be joined at login.
[Sun Apr 21 09:37:59 2002] Tarlof says, 'they said temporarily there's a way to access the search for the old archives'
[Sun Apr 21 09:38:20 2002] It begins to rain.
[Sun Apr 21 09:38:36 2002] Aryante has a question.
[Sun Apr 21 09:38:36 2002] Kilm says, 'Is the autojoin not bugged for some and the only way to fix it is to edit the ini file and leave the line blank of true or false ?'
[Sun Apr 21 09:38:55 2002] Faelinn says, 'you can do it in game too'
[Sun Apr 21 09:38:56 2002] The spirit leaves you.

[Sun Apr 21 09:39:20 2002] Kedian says, 'well, ive tryed both ways kilm. I think removing the whole line kills it, otherwise you get an 'attemping to join' message when you login, and 'you are not on any channels' message'
[Sun Apr 21 09:39:35 2002] Lancet says, 'guys and gls we going to take a 10 min break to clean que and give gm timwe to get here'
