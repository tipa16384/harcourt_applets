[Tue Jun 19 18:19:25 2001] You tell your party, 'You can always tell a guide who doesn't have it printed out... but worse, it makes what we do seem inconsistent in the eyes of the players.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:19:27 2001] Devynn GMSAYS, 'wow, that doesn't seem bad at all'
[Tue Jun 19 18:19:37 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'There is also the problem of I can't let my character grow...Zil started as a kid and grew up to be the aged shaman he is, I don't have to think up his lines, he just says them on his own...you can't really pull a character like that out of'
[Tue Jun 19 18:19:40 2001] You tell your party, 'And that's bad. We should always respond the same way to the same sitation.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:19:40 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'thin air ya know?'
[Tue Jun 19 18:19:42 2001] Mersi GMSAYS, 'hehe Ryn and Kez made me change it...'
[Tue Jun 19 18:19:53 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'yes, I understand the problem that creates.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:19:59 2001] You told Zildrax, 'well, you could use the same sort of character...'
[Tue Jun 19 18:20:19 2001] Devynn GMSAYS, 'hehe, now he wants Reaver, told him no on that one, can we just perhaps remove his surname for now while he thinks of a new one?'
[Tue Jun 19 18:20:19 2001] You tell your party, 'There are a few rules in the Apprentice guidelines that deserve repeating...'
[Tue Jun 19 18:20:30 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, '*All Ears*'
[Tue Jun 19 18:20:37 2001] Nazbag GMSAYS, 'whats wrong with Reaver?'
[Tue Jun 19 18:20:44 2001] You tell your party, 'First, always be polite. If a player is being nasty -- just escalate it to your mentor.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:20:45 2001] Devynn GMSAYS, 'Gnoll Reaver'
[Tue Jun 19 18:20:47 2001] Devynn GMSAYS, 'Dark Reaver'
[Tue Jun 19 18:20:48 2001] Mersi GMSAYS, 'nothing wrong with reaver that I know of... Pathfinder is allowed'
[Tue Jun 19 18:20:56 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'I dunno, I'm just not sure if it'd really work...it seems so limiting in what I can do.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:21:00 2001] Devynn GMSAYS, 'I figured it was something in the game'
[Tue Jun 19 18:21:06 2001] Xonovinn takes notes.
[Tue Jun 19 18:21:06 2001] Synder GMSAYS, 'zoning'
[Tue Jun 19 18:21:18 2001] You tell your party, 'We're all human and sometimes we can be rubbed the wrong way. But to the customer, it is important to always be friendly and polite. This can often ease tense situations.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:21:24 2001] Nazbag GMSAYS, 'Reaver is syn for marauder, it should be ok'
[Tue Jun 19 18:21:34 2001] You told Zildrax, 'well.... but without having to worry about leveling and all that - it's pure RP'
[Tue Jun 19 18:21:36 2001] Devynn GMSAYS, 'oh well, he choose another one already'
[Tue Jun 19 18:21:38 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'Understood.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:21:58 2001] Devynn GMSAYS, 'sending zelren back up'
[Tue Jun 19 18:22:07 2001] You tell your party, 'We are here for one reason only - to help people. No matter how important or trivial a petition may seem to us, it is important to the petitioner.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:22:07 2001] Devynn GMSAYS, 'it's in gm txt'
[Tue Jun 19 18:22:15 2001] You tell your party, 'Therefore we NEVER ignore a petition.'

[Tue Jun 19 18:22:30 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'But I also couldn't hunt with people IC, or go their events just cause I think their cool...'
[Tue Jun 19 18:22:45 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'The main thing that bugs me is the whole lack of ability to show favortism'
[Tue Jun 19 18:22:47 2001] You told Zildrax, 'that's true, your job would be to enhance the atmosphere.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:22:51 2001] You told Zildrax, 'heh'
[Tue Jun 19 18:22:54 2001] Espranza saved.
[Tue Jun 19 18:23:01 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'Ok.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:23:08 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'I WANT to sow favortism. If somebody makes a cool plot, I wanna use it and help make it work.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:23:09 2001] You tell your party, 'Next, when you're in a zone, people may shout out to you or say hello or whatnot.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:23:10 2001] Devynn GMSAYS, '*is going to print out the naming policy tomorrow at work so he has it in front of him*'
[Tue Jun 19 18:23:40 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'I don't feel like I can really enchance the atmosphere if I can't do things like that...'
[Tue Jun 19 18:23:44 2001] You tell your party, 'Or you may want to address the whole zone at once to resolve some zonewide argument or something. But nonetheless, we never use /ooc or /shout unless directed to by the SMT.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:23:59 2001] You told Zildrax, 'I don't see why you couldn't...'
[Tue Jun 19 18:24:13 2001] Mersi GMSAYS, 'zone'
[Tue Jun 19 18:24:25 2001] You tell your party, 'Roleplaying is often ignored, but if you like that, please feel free to do so as much as possible.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:24:27 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'Would that also include zone wide swearing? I recall the PnP addressing that as an exception if memory serves.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:24:32 2001] You tell your party, 'It adds to the flavor of the game.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:24:36 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'Ok.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:24:50 2001] You tell your party, 'Even with zone wide swearing - you can get permission to address the zone.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:24:56 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'Ok.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:25:16 2001] You tell your party, 'We have other tools to use. Addressing the zone implies an authority we don't really have.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:25:17 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'So to reiterate... absolutely no ooc zone wide without permission. Got it.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:25:21 2001] You tell your party, 'Righto.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:25:36 2001] You tell your party, 'The last thing to remember is - take notes. And lots of them.'

[Tue Jun 19 18:25:57 2001] You tell your party, 'They will be invaluable as learning tools, and when you make your daily shift report (DSR).'
[Tue Jun 19 18:26:19 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'Well...as I said it's too limiting. if Zil see's somebody who he thinks he can convert to worshipping Cazic-Thule, he'll try, on an individual basis, usually alone somewhere where nobody else can interfere...'
[Tue Jun 19 18:26:22 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'Ok. I keep a notepad close anyway. 8)'
[Tue Jun 19 18:26:26 2001] Devynn GMSAYS, 'escing Hendolek, merchant out of place'
[Tue Jun 19 18:26:35 2001] You tell your party, 'So you might have already written down that you met with Mersi, she told you about our wonderful SMT, and you were being trained by Espranza, Kaweewee and Nazbag'
[Tue Jun 19 18:26:40 2001] Devynn GMSAYS, 'pulling Gealan'
[Tue Jun 19 18:26:56 2001] You told Zildrax, 'So... don't do it... it was only an idea :)'

[Tue Jun 19 18:27:19 2001] Synder GMSAYS, 'zoning'
[Tue Jun 19 18:27:24 2001] You told Zildrax, 'Have you talked to Verant about it yet?'
[Tue Jun 19 18:27:38 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'No, I haven't, been too busy trying to catch my friend hehe'
[Tue Jun 19 18:27:48 2001] You tell your party, 'Your main tool at this stage is your game knowledge and your common sense.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:28:03 2001] You tell your party, 'If you don't know the answer to an issue, ask over our private chat channel, /pr.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:28:06 2001] You told Zildrax, 'heh'
[Tue Jun 19 18:28:12 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'But I doubt they'd let me...'
[Tue Jun 19 18:28:39 2001] You tell your party, 'Someone will answer you, even if it's an "I don't know"... keep in mind /pr is often busy and guides zone frequently'
[Tue Jun 19 18:28:41 2001] Devynn GMSAYS, 'Escing Gealan, intentional training issue'
[Tue Jun 19 18:28:47 2001] You told Zildrax, 'worth asking them.'

[Tue Jun 19 18:28:52 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'Aye.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:28:58 2001] You tell your party, 'so if you don't get an answer, ask again in a little bit.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:29:33 2001] You tell your party, 'If the guides don't know either, then tell the customer that this is new to us and you will enter it into your DSR and try to find an answer for next time.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:29:53 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'Still unsure if I'd want to do it on any other server besides MT....it would so rock to do it here hehe'
[Tue Jun 19 18:29:57 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'I would imagine that doesn't go over well?'
[Tue Jun 19 18:30:06 2001] You tell your party, 'Once it's posted on the message board, all the guides can see it and perhaps have an answer.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:30:09 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'With the customer I mean.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:30:16 2001] You told Zildrax, 'You could not do it on MT. That's a given.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:30:16 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'Ok.'

[Tue Jun 19 18:30:51 2001] You tell your party, 'They tend to ascribe powers to us we don't have.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:31:04 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'Although really the only thing I could do as a persistant character I can't do now i can think of is spawn NPC's.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:31:18 2001] You tell your party, 'But most know we want to do the best we can.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:31:29 2001] You told Zildrax, 'you couldn't do that - sorry.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:31:35 2001] You told Zildrax, 'only GMs can.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:31:38 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'doh'
[Tue Jun 19 18:31:47 2001] You tell your party, 'Any questions so far?'
[Tue Jun 19 18:31:54 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'then not sure what being one would actually let me do...hmm hehehe'
[Tue Jun 19 18:32:00 2001] You told Zildrax, 'heh'

[Tue Jun 19 18:32:56 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'Let me get the list, basically dungeons and I think most Velious areas.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:33:04 2001] Espranza saved.
[Tue Jun 19 18:33:07 2001] Synder GMSAYS, 'hahaha training in the name of evil thats not right, but its a bit funny I must say'
[Tue Jun 19 18:33:15 2001] You tell your party, 'That's pretty much it - you can't go to Skyfire either.'

[Tue Jun 19 18:33:48 2001] You tell your party, 'You must always announce you are doing so.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:33:52 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'Oh well. I need 3 items to be officially "complete" with ym character...then It seems I'll basically have all the abilities of said persistant characters and more hehe'
[Tue Jun 19 18:33:59 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'Oh yes, I remember now, to move through.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:34:03 2001] You tell your party, 'In fact, you must always announce whenever you zone. Even full guides and up do this.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:34:12 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'Ok.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:34:16 2001] The spirit leaves you.
[Tue Jun 19 18:34:18 2001] You told Zildrax, 'well... but only here!'
[Tue Jun 19 18:34:48 2001] You tell your party, 'As an apprentice, you'll announce pretty much everything you do over /pr... from taking petitions and working with them...'
[Tue Jun 19 18:34:58 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'Ok.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:34:58 2001] Mersi tells the guild, 'make sure to tell them DSRs need to be posted within an hour of their shift unless they have problems, in which case they should email SMT )'

[Tue Jun 19 18:35:22 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'I don't really need to do it anywhere else. I suppose no, i don't effect Norrath itself, and that part is kinda dissapointing, but I can and am influenceing about 6 different guilds storylines.'

[Tue Jun 19 18:37:15 2001] You tell your party, 'But it would be best if you had a guide here with you. You should always be grouped with a guide or better when you apprentice.'

[Tue Jun 19 18:37:24 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'hehehe I guess right now I don't have much reason to make a persistant char'

[Tue Jun 19 18:37:52 2001] You tell your party, 'And I should mention - you never, never, never group with players.'
[Tue Jun 19 18:37:58 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'I just gotta stay ahead of them in level so I can keep everyone intimidated. *grins*'
[Tue Jun 19 18:38:04 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'As the PnP states.  I will not.'

[Tue Jun 19 18:39:58 2001] Zildrax tells you, 'So I guess I'd do the same things I plan to do once I complete my character. Hang with friends, get invovled in RP stories, and get lotsa money to buy things for my friend'
[Tue Jun 19 18:40:07 2001] Xonovinn tells the group, 'The PnP proposed that we are equal but that we do not "nullify" a GMs decision.'
