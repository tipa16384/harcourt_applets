[Sat Nov 17 16:02:22 2001] Espranza saved.
[Sat Nov 17 16:02:37 2001] You told Rahaven, 'your next one is: don't run, create or participate in historical quests - go into detail about what that means.'
[Sat Nov 17 16:02:40 2001] Rahaven tells the group, 'you may do so, under the guidance of a mentoring G+, in order to learn more about what you will be doing later'
[Sat Nov 17 16:02:55 2001] Rahaven tells you, 'Got it. Done here :)'
[Sat Nov 17 16:03:27 2001] You tell your party, 'DON'T handle exploit, abuse, or harassment issues - these get escalated without contact to full guides (escalated to yellow).'

[Sat Nov 17 16:03:46 2001] Lirus GMSAYS, 'zone'
[Sat Nov 17 16:04:01 2001] You tell your party, 'Don't worry about that, it happens - but break off contact and escalate once you know it is something for a full guide to investigate'

[Sat Nov 17 16:05:00 2001] Rahaven tells the group, 'I know you've read some on this already, in your PnP. While you may roleplay here, in fact you are strongly encouraged to... historical quests we stay away from'
[Sat Nov 17 16:05:15 2001] Rahaven tells the group, 'In fact, now that you're in the guide program...'

[Sat Nov 17 16:06:13 2001] Rahaven tells the group, 'Better safe than wrong. We do get to participate or act in small invasions here, and miniquests, as guide-actors, and most of us consider that to be a great compensation for it'
[Sat Nov 17 16:06:14 2001] Agaden tells the guild, 'You know, transparent mode would be much more usefull if they let you resize all the boxes and, for guides, if they removed the spell icon boxes.'

[Sat Nov 17 16:07:14 2001] You tell your party, 'DON'T reprimand the players! This is for full guides to do, unless you're told otherwise. And don't reprimand guides, either... this is for seniors to do!'

[Sat Nov 17 16:08:36 2001] You tell your party, 'DON'T give warnings to players! If a customer is irking you, give it over to a full guide. We live to take them off your hands, and we will issue any needed warnings should they persist.'

[Sat Nov 17 16:09:10 2001] Rahaven tells the group, 'DON'T tell anyone you're a guide. This is what we refer to as Real Life Roleplay mode :) You will get friends and guildmembers asking where you are- you may not disclose you're a guide'
[Sat Nov 17 16:09:13 2001] Rahaven tells you, 'done'
[Sat Nov 17 16:09:18 2001] Agaden GMSAYS, 'Time to get the heck outta Dodge!  Zone!'

[Sat Nov 17 16:09:59 2001] You tell your party, 'Guides on other servers shouldn't even know you are a guide'
[Sat Nov 17 16:10:33 2001] You say to your guild, 'Lirus, could you buff the appies please?'
[Sat Nov 17 16:10:38 2001] Agaden tells the guild, 'hehe, my problem with this zone is that I have no clue where anything is...this is the first time I have been in it'
[Sat Nov 17 16:10:51 2001] Rynara tells the guild, 'ahhh hehe ok'
[Sat Nov 17 16:10:54 2001] Lirus tells the guild, 'yes in a few minutes or do they need it right now?'
[Sat Nov 17 16:10:58 2001] Dalios tells the group, 'The RL bit, how does that apply with housemates or neighbors? If they're over at your house, will be awfully hard to lie about what you're doing...'
[Sat Nov 17 16:11:02 2001] You say to your guild, 'we're to that point now'
[Sat Nov 17 16:11:16 2001] You tell your party, 'If they play EQ, you can't tell them'
