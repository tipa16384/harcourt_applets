[Fri Oct 12 09:31:31 2001] Oraden GMSAYS, 'aye, the hybrid penalty was kinda odd... I agree in some respects.... but when halfling druids took 90 percent and wood elf rangers took 140 percent .... it just made no sense ;)'
[Fri Oct 12 09:31:40 2001] You GMSAY, 'All three MMORPGs I've played have some sort of death penalty; Camelot, Kingdom of the Winds and EQ.'

[Fri Oct 12 09:33:40 2001] You told Mandranir, 'Verant said it was not their fault (I don't work for them, so I must rely on what they tell me), and therefore they won't authorize rezzes.'
[Fri Oct 12 09:33:59 2001] Aelorian GMSAYS, 'and rangers had LOTS of dots + warrior abilities '
[Fri Oct 12 09:34:31 2001] You say to your guild, 'aye, but I have to point out that at the levels where it really huurts, you get 56 3.077886e-301xp rezzes most of the time. Camelot's penalty, while seemingly less severe, is not.'
[Fri Oct 12 09:34:55 2001] Mandranir tells you, 'and do they authorize summon corpse because when i die without ahaving aggroed any mobs i think it's not my fault. '

[Fri Oct 12 09:36:21 2001] Aelorian GMSAYS, 'then in beta 2, they "nerfed" rangers and other hybrids...but still kept the xp penalty'
[Fri Oct 12 09:36:24 2001] You say to your guild, 'right... also... what would happen if in EQ it cost you 100pp every time you died and didn't get rezzed?'
[Fri Oct 12 09:36:37 2001] You say to your guild, 'and you only had five minutes to get rezzed?'
[Fri Oct 12 09:36:39 2001] Aelorian GMSAYS, 'hybrids were still deemed "too powerful"'
