[Sat Jul 07 15:36:15 2001] Mersi tells the guild, 'ok lemme check date'
[Sat Jul 07 15:36:34 2001] You say, 'If nobody knows the answer to the question, then tell the customer this is a new situation and you will include it in your shift report - and do so.'
[Sat Jul 07 15:36:52 2001] You say, 'You post these things up on our guide message boards, and very often someone there will be able to answer.'
[Sat Jul 07 15:37:00 2001] You say, 'Any questions so far?'
