[Tue Jul 03 18:14:24 2001] Dellis says, 'conversationally or in duties?'
[Tue Jul 03 18:14:49 2001] You say, 'well generally, how the guide program works with GMs.'
[Tue Jul 03 18:15:21 2001] Kizra says, 'I'd say that, while there is not a strict chain of command, one would consider the GM most senior on the server and try to find answers prior to disturbing them...'
[Tue Jul 03 18:15:29 2001] Espranza saved.
[Tue Jul 03 18:15:48 2001] You say, 'That is certainly true - but guides and GMs are separate programs working to the same goal.'
[Tue Jul 03 18:15:48 2001] Dellis says, 'they are the top of the ladder -- they have all the authority and all the power and handle things otherwise undoable by guides'
[Tue Jul 03 18:16:06 2001] Fweep could have sworn he read that we do not interact with GMS on a game level . we escalate petitions upwards and let the seniors and or elders deal with items goign to GMs.
[Tue Jul 03 18:16:10 2001] You say, 'GMs are not our bosses; seniors are, and beyond them, the elder, who was actually here tonight.'
[Tue Jul 03 18:16:26 2001] You say, 'GMs are not quite so unapprochable.'
[Tue Jul 03 18:16:33 2001] Dellis shudders in awe of seeing Semiramis.
[Tue Jul 03 18:16:38 2001] You say, 'We are two separate programs working to the same goal.'
[Tue Jul 03 18:16:57 2001] Fweep guesses he can't read.
[Tue Jul 03 18:17:15 2001] Larsot GMSAYS, 'deleting pet, problem solved'
[Tue Jul 03 18:17:23 2001] Kizra says, 'It would be safe to say, then, that the GM is the administrator where we/you have more of the interaction duties?'

[Tue Jul 03 18:17:33 2001] Larsot GMSAYS, 'pulling Gnostik'

[Tue Jul 03 18:17:53 2001] Kaweewee says, 'our gm does interact, but on issues we or seniors cant solve'
[Tue Jul 03 18:18:03 2001] Kizra says, 'Ahhh, gotcha.'
[Tue Jul 03 18:18:03 2001] Larsot GMSAYS, 'is the surname Gnollhugger legal?'
[Tue Jul 03 18:18:08 2001] You GMSAY, 'yup'
[Tue Jul 03 18:18:10 2001] Fweep says, 'So the question was never answered.'
[Tue Jul 03 18:18:21 2001] Larsot GMSAYS, 'ok, wasnt sure cause of the Gnoll part'
[Tue Jul 03 18:18:30 2001] Kaweewee says, 'what question'
[Tue Jul 03 18:18:41 2001] You say, 'We interact as equals.'
[Tue Jul 03 18:18:44 2001] You say, 'short answer'
[Tue Jul 03 18:19:18 2001] Fweep says, 'Then your word "Relate" meant how we are viewed to each other, NOT to how we take issues to them.'
[Tue Jul 03 18:19:19 2001] You say, 'okay... please, please - ask lots of questions.'
[Tue Jul 03 18:19:30 2001] You say, 'oh, yes that's what I meant.'
[Tue Jul 03 18:19:31 2001] Fweep says, 'Hence my confusion.'
[Tue Jul 03 18:19:36 2001] Espranza rolls her eyes.
[Tue Jul 03 18:19:49 2001] Fweep grrs.
[Tue Jul 03 18:19:53 2001] Kizra chuckles, finding herself guilty of the same thought pattern.

[Tue Jul 03 18:21:15 2001] You say, 'come to them with any problems you might be having guiding or anything.'
[Tue Jul 03 18:21:19 2001] You GMSAY, 'ASHLANNE!'
[Tue Jul 03 18:21:20 2001] Eryndale GMSAYS, 'hi Ashlanne!!!'

[Tue Jul 03 19:32:09 2001] Dellis says, 'nope that would be user stupidity .. I mean users mistke'
[Tue Jul 03 19:32:22 2001] You say, 'then Verant should fix that, so it IS a bug - an acknowledged one, too'

[Tue Jul 03 19:33:38 2001] Eryndale GMSAYS, 'was there a patch last night at all?'
