[Sat Aug 25 16:02:39 2001] Salvander laughs at Espranza.
[Sat Aug 25 16:02:55 2001] You tell your party, 'Keep in mind /pr is often busy and guides zone frequently, so if you don't get an answer right away, just ask again in a moment...'
[Sat Aug 25 16:02:58 2001] You look at Salvander, completely puzzled.
[Sat Aug 25 16:03:15 2001] Lirus tells the group, 'stress that point'

[Sat Aug 25 16:04:01 2001] You tell your party, 'Then post it and ask around - someone nearly always knows the answer.'
[Sat Aug 25 16:04:17 2001] Espranza cracks her knuckles.
[Sat Aug 25 16:04:22 2001] You tell your party, 'Any questions so far?'
[Sat Aug 25 16:04:29 2001] Salvander says, 'none'
