[Thu Nov 15 21:01:32 2001] Jaled Dar`s shade says 'When the tomb was closed and the entry sealed, many dragons participated in the ceremony.  They invested portions of their essence into the seal.  The seal is part of them now.  With the right talismans, I can show you how to make a key that will allow one to pass, as if they were of the First Brood.  If you do not wish to do this for the good of all, perhaps you will be willing to do it for material riches.  Priceless treasures are stored in the tomb, yours for the taking, once you are inside and have released The Sleeper. 
[Thu Nov 15 21:01:35 2001] You told Dolcemorte, 'doing okay! how have you been?'

[Thu Nov 15 21:15:06 2001] You say, 'you guys should just do guild war and settle it once and for all'
[Thu Nov 15 21:15:30 2001] Trystych says, 'pity the changes that happen after sleeper is freed, I'd much rather see the warders remain up but sleeper gone from bubble for good'
[Thu Nov 15 21:15:49 2001] You say, 'yeah well, if FE releases him, TW can put him back'
[Thu Nov 15 21:15:58 2001] You say, 'THAT would be a tale to tell!'

[Thu Nov 15 21:19:59 2001] Trystych says, 'I spend most of my time on raids soloing, I actually don't mind it much now that the mobs are lifetappable for the most part'
[Thu Nov 15 21:20:47 2001] You say, 'soloing, meaning ungrouped?'
[Thu Nov 15 21:21:00 2001] Trystych says, 'yeah, I make the groups most of the time'
[Thu Nov 15 21:21:39 2001] Trystych says, 'planning raids and doing the groups/tactics is what I love most about eq, when it all comes together and a mob we haven't been able to kill before drops'
[Thu Nov 15 21:22:11 2001] You say, 'oh, we feel that way - when we did the old Maestro the first time, and then the new one.. or when we killed Faydedar in just seconds with no deaths...'

[Thu Nov 15 21:23:24 2001] Trystych says, 'small units work much better for quite a bit, armor farming in tov, but quite a few of the big fights boil down to numbers'
[Thu Nov 15 21:23:46 2001] Trystych says, 'I wasn't too impressed with the dark elf and high elf, looks too similar to current one'
[Thu Nov 15 21:23:52 2001] Trystych says, 'the eyes on all of them look pretty cool though'
