[Sat Feb 02 15:13:46 2002] Kilm says, 'If no one can answer the question or doesn't know then tell the customer that its a new Issue to us and that we will enter it into our Status report and get further guidance'
[Sat Feb 02 15:14:16 2002] Kilm says, 'The post it and ask around, you'd be surprized the asnwers you  can learn from other guides '
[Sat Feb 02 15:14:23 2002] Kilm says, 'Any questions so far ?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:14:24 2002] Lancet GMSAYS, 'nexus port from gd is down summon anyone whos trying to go'

[Sat Feb 02 15:16:11 2002] Kilm says, 'Great, :=) '
[Sat Feb 02 15:16:34 2002] Kilm says, 'Just remember to anoounce that over /pr when your going thru Runnyeye and Blackburrow '

[Sat Feb 02 15:17:06 2002] Kilm says, 'When can a Apprentice be online ?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:17:17 2002] Espranza saved.
[Sat Feb 02 15:17:18 2002] Delayne says, 'When a GM or Full guide is on'
[Sat Feb 02 15:17:18 2002] Llara the Mysterious cracks her whip in Delayne's direction and says, 'Well, if you are a guide, then what the heck are you doing here!?! Get to work on the queue, it's not going to be under 20 all day!' '

[Sat Feb 02 15:18:41 2002] Kilm says, 'How do you think GM's relate to guides ?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:18:50 2002] Delayne says, 'GM > guides'
[Sat Feb 02 15:19:02 2002] Kilm grins.

[Sat Feb 02 15:24:42 2002] Kilm says, 'that still correct Esp ?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:24:48 2002] Kilm says, 'Ahh ok :) '
[Sat Feb 02 15:24:56 2002] You say, 'I'm in charge of apprentices now :)'
[Sat Feb 02 15:25:00 2002] Kilm says, 'Espranza will give you the proper email '
[Sat Feb 02 15:25:09 2002] You say to your guild, 'Mersi is still awaiting her transfer'
[Sat Feb 02 15:25:20 2002] Kilm tells the guild, 'Ok, wasn't sure on it.. '
[Sat Feb 02 15:25:31 2002] Kilm tells the guild, '<-- will update training script :D '
[Sat Feb 02 15:25:34 2002] You say, 'my email is brendah@mbay.net, but you can just send them to the SMT address as wel'

[Sat Feb 02 15:25:47 2002] Kilm says, 'If you need anything guide related  let the seniors know '
[Sat Feb 02 15:26:14 2002] Kilm says, 'You can do that by either contacting them in game or by sending email to the SMT email address '
[Sat Feb 02 15:26:40 2002] Kilm says, 'Also, when sending any email witin the program....'
[Sat Feb 02 15:26:47 2002] Kilm says, 'Please include your guide name '
[Sat Feb 02 15:26:58 2002] Kilm says, 'Also... '
[Sat Feb 02 15:27:36 2002] Kilm says, 'if you can't make the 6 hours a week for guiding you need to let the Seniors know ...its important they get the information as quickly as possible '
[Sat Feb 02 15:27:45 2002] Kilm says, 'Any questions at this time ?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:27:48 2002] Hayama says, 'Should we go directly to /pr for questions, or can we ask our current mentor at the time?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:27:50 2002] You say to your guild, 'actually, we no longer have a 6 hour requirement.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:28:01 2002] You say to your guild, 'they should just be urged to guide as much as they can.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:28:06 2002] Kilm tells the guild, ':=) ok '
[Sat Feb 02 15:28:07 2002] You feel the spirit of Norrath enter you.
[Sat Feb 02 15:28:16 2002] Kilm says, 'either or '
[Sat Feb 02 15:28:24 2002] Hayama says, 'Also, which e-mail is most preferable for DSR?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:28:29 2002] Hayama says, 'Same indifference? hehe.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:28:35 2002] Kilm says, 'whichever is good for you, sometime even when being mentored the mentor is busy '
[Sat Feb 02 15:28:43 2002] Hayama nods at Kilm.
[Sat Feb 02 15:28:47 2002] Delayne says, 'I got an email with a password for the guide board, but I can't seem to hit it with my browser, am I doing something wrong, or.... ?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:28:47 2002] Llara the Mysterious cracks her whip in Delayne's direction and says, 'Well, if you are a guide, then what the heck are you doing here!?! Get to work on the queue, it's not going to be under 20 all day!' '
[Sat Feb 02 15:28:59 2002] You say, 'We prefer you to ask over /pr, since others may have the same question.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:29:03 2002] Kilm says, 'well.. the guide board ...'
[Sat Feb 02 15:29:14 2002] You say, 'and asking over /pr allows all guides and apprentices to chime in with answers :)'
[Sat Feb 02 15:29:19 2002] Kilm says, 'make sure you put a "s" after the http...'
[Sat Feb 02 15:29:25 2002] Hayama nods.
[Sat Feb 02 15:29:35 2002] Kilm says, 'it should look like this:'

[Sat Feb 02 15:29:44 2002] Kilm says, 'https://guide.everquest.com'
[Sat Feb 02 15:29:56 2002] Delayne says, 'And then we use our regular log in name with the new password?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:30:00 2002] Kilm says, 'yes'
[Sat Feb 02 15:30:07 2002] You say, 'aye, your station name for your play account.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:30:13 2002] You say, 'and the password sent to you.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:30:51 2002] Requesting to change Kilm's height from 7 to 6.
[Sat Feb 02 15:30:52 2002] Kilm says, 'If that works for you, you will not need to send your DSR's to Espranza, just post them under the MT board DSR section '
[Sat Feb 02 15:31:07 2002] Lancet GMSAYS, 'ZONING'
[Sat Feb 02 15:31:12 2002] Kilm says, 'they have Names set up for them Esp ?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:31:14 2002] You say, 'You'll see a place for new apprentices - post your DSRs as a reply to that until you have a heading of your own.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:31:26 2002] Kilm =) 
[Sat Feb 02 15:31:27 2002] You say, 'you'll get a place of your own next Friday...'
[Sat Feb 02 15:31:43 2002] Kilm says, 'yes, your own zip code :) '
[Sat Feb 02 15:31:48 2002] Hayama cheer.
[Sat Feb 02 15:31:51 2002] Hayama says, 's.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:31:59 2002] Kilm tells you, 'you doing do and don'ts ?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:32:05 2002] Hayama coughs innocently.
[Sat Feb 02 15:32:10 2002] Lancet GMSAYS, 'going to chat to see if lirus is working tyoday if not ill get our cover gm here'
[Sat Feb 02 15:32:12 2002] You told Kilm, 'sure'
[Sat Feb 02 15:32:14 2002] Delayne says, 'I can't get in, is that normal or am I messing up?  :)'
[Sat Feb 02 15:32:16 2002] You GMSAY, 'okay, thanks'
[Sat Feb 02 15:32:18 2002] Kilm tells you, 'thanks :) '
[Sat Feb 02 15:32:38 2002] You say, 'it comes up with the password screen'
[Sat Feb 02 15:32:38 2002] Delayne says, 'I was messing up. ;)'
[Sat Feb 02 15:32:41 2002] You say, '?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:32:45 2002] You say, 'oh...'
[Sat Feb 02 15:33:01 2002] Delayne says, 'lol.  sorry. :)  I'm out of questions now, I'll be quiet again. :)'
[Sat Feb 02 15:33:04 2002] You no longer have a target.
[Sat Feb 02 15:33:07 2002] You smile.
[Sat Feb 02 15:33:09 2002] Kilm says, 'Any more questions ?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:33:19 2002] Hayama shakes his head.
[Sat Feb 02 15:33:34 2002] You say, 'okay... then let's cover the DOs and the DON'Ts of guiding.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:33:41 2002] Espranza saved.
[Sat Feb 02 15:34:11 2002] You say, 'Do ask questions as much as possible. Keep in mind that we guides are asked to evaluate your performance, and often all we have to go on are your questions and chatter over /pr.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:34:32 2002] You say, 'If you don't get an answer right away, ask again in a few seconds... sometimes we miss questions while zoning.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:34:53 2002] You say, 'DO explore the world as much as possible! At least in those places apprentices can go.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:35:17 2002] You say, 'Guides may sometimes take you to places you ought not go alone for training, but not for exploration...'
[Sat Feb 02 15:36:01 2002] You say, 'DO participate in answer circles! That's when you and one or more players gather in some safe place to answer questions, roleplay and such. It's one of the most enjoyable things to do while guiding and really helps to get to know the players.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:36:21 2002] You say, 'DON'T explore ANY dungeons! You can do all you like when you become a full guide.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:37:13 2002] You say, 'DON'T handle any exploit, abuse, or harassment petitions. These get escalated without contact to a full guide (yellow, in the queue). If the petition was vague and you didn't know that it WAS one of those, escalate it as soon as you do know.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:38:15 2002] You say, 'DON'T run, create or participate in Historical quests, either here or on your play server. These are the sorts of quests involving the famous NPCs of Norrath, not invasion GM events or the like.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:39:02 2002] You say, 'As a guide on Morell-Thule, you will have extra information that normal players do not have, and it wouldn't be fair for you to participate in these quests as a player.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:39:38 2002] You say, 'If you find yourself in the same zone as a historical quest, leave as soon as possible, even if it means changing where you hunt for th enight.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:40:17 2002] You say, 'Staying in the zone could be viewed as a guide leak. Participating in or telling your friends about the quest IS a guide leak, and will be frowned upon.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:40:33 2002] You say, 'In compensation, you get to act in quests yourself, which is a lot more fun anyway!'
[Sat Feb 02 15:40:44 2002] You say to your guild, 'you're the QC, Kilm?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:40:53 2002] Kilm tells the guild, 'yes'
[Sat Feb 02 15:41:00 2002] You say to your guild, 'thought so!'
[Sat Feb 02 15:41:00 2002] Hayama cackles gleefully.
[Sat Feb 02 15:41:21 2002] You say, 'Kilm is our Quest Coordinator (when does he sleep?) so you'll be seeing a lot of him in these things.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:41:29 2002] You say, 'Moving on...'
[Sat Feb 02 15:41:38 2002] Kilm sleeps less than 5 hours a day :( 
[Sat Feb 02 15:42:17 2002] You say, 'DON'T reprimand players. That's what guides are for! And don't reprimand guides... that's what seniors are for! And um... don't reprimand seniors, that's what elder guides are for :)'
[Sat Feb 02 15:42:50 2002] You say, 'DON'T speak for the guide program by posting in any public forum. The Communications Team takes care of that.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:43:38 2002] You say, 'DON'T give warnings to players. If a customer is getting on your nerves, hand it over to a full guide. We yearn to take them off your hands and take whatever actions seem necessary!'
[Sat Feb 02 15:43:43 2002] Lancet GMSAYS, 'ok got Deyvon coming no one has seen Lirus'
[Sat Feb 02 15:43:49 2002] You GMSAY, 'okay!'
[Sat Feb 02 15:43:51 2002] Espranza saved.
[Sat Feb 02 15:44:00 2002] Kilm GMSAYS, 'thanks Lancet :) '
[Sat Feb 02 15:44:06 2002] Lancet GMSAYS, 'might be a few'
[Sat Feb 02 15:44:40 2002] Lancet GMSAYS, 'ok im going to bed good luck'
[Sat Feb 02 15:44:46 2002] Kilm tells the guild, 'any idea if the illusion bug is fixed yet ?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:44:51 2002] Kilm GMSAYS, 'night Lancet '
[Sat Feb 02 15:44:54 2002] You say, 'DON'T tell your friends, guild mates, play server guides, GMs, pets, random strangers etc. that you are a guide. When you are not here on MT guiding, you are no different than any other player.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:44:57 2002] You say to your guild, 'it isn't...'
[Sat Feb 02 15:44:59 2002] Lancet tells the guild, 'have not heard dont think so'
[Sat Feb 02 15:45:02 2002] You GMSAY, 'night Lancet! Get better!'
[Sat Feb 02 15:45:18 2002] Kilm tells the guild, 'hehe ok... wish they would get that fixed... need to do some quests :D '
[Sat Feb 02 15:45:44 2002] You say, 'Also, never tell any player here on MT what your play server or play character names are! These two parts of your life must remain mutually exclusive.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:46:13 2002] You say, 'We DO catch guides who expose themselves as such on their play server...'
[Sat Feb 02 15:46:46 2002] You say, 'However, you can tell your fellow guides here on MT about your play server and characters, it's nice to find people on the same server as you!'
[Sat Feb 02 15:47:08 2002] You say, 'I play on Erollisi Marr, and am now guildmates with another guide here on MT, so it works out :)'
[Sat Feb 02 15:47:09 2002] Kilm says, '<--- plays on Fennin ro :p '
[Sat Feb 02 15:47:19 2002] Hayama cheers for the Rathe.
[Sat Feb 02 15:47:24 2002] Delayne says, 'TM > *'
[Sat Feb 02 15:47:35 2002] You no longer have a target.
[Sat Feb 02 15:47:36 2002] You smile.
[Sat Feb 02 15:48:23 2002] You say, 'DON'T duel with players, ever. You may only duel in the CSHome arena here... when you get to be a full guide.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:48:33 2002] Hayama emits a low rumble and then roars like a lion!
[Sat Feb 02 15:49:08 2002] You say, 'DON'T be a lush. In game drinking for roleplay reasons is fine, one drink only, but no more.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:49:15 2002] You say, 'Nobody likes a drunk guide.'
[Sat Feb 02 15:49:53 2002] Deyvon GMSAYS, 'Heya, need some appie buffing?'
[Sat Feb 02 15:49:58 2002] You say, 'I know you realize what a large responsibility joining the guide program is. We have fun, we joke around, but we never forget that we are here to serve the customers!'
