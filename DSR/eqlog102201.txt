[Mon Oct 22 18:22:01 2001] Disden GMSAYS, 'deleting petition asked her to repet later *sorry for the interuption*'
[Mon Oct 22 18:22:49 2001] Rynara says, 'so with that said, if there is anything having to do with the guide program that needs to be addressed, you need to email or talk with the seniors'
[Mon Oct 22 18:23:21 2001] Lirus = < seniors on guide issues.
[Mon Oct 22 18:23:39 2001] Rynara says, 'transfers, resignations etc...'

[Mon Oct 22 18:25:28 2001] Abbadabba hugs Lirus.
[Mon Oct 22 18:25:34 2001] Dalharil says, 'Would GM Lirus find it more helpful to not only include possible reimbursement issues and other GM issues in the DSR's.. but email them directly to him?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:25:55 2001] Dalharil says, 'or would that be just too overwhelming in the mail box?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:26:38 2001] Lirus says, 'If i am not on and the player seeks a reimbursal, as long as they are not under level 6 or admit to somehow faulting on the items to make em disappearer (more) for example'
[Mon Oct 22 18:26:39 2001] Mersi pokes Lirus to see if he's alive.
[Mon Oct 22 18:26:54 2001] Lirus says, 'saying they deleted em, gave to wrong NPC, any of the reasons that are NOT bug related...'
[Mon Oct 22 18:27:15 2001] Faelinn says, 'cazza ld'
[Mon Oct 22 18:27:16 2001] Lirus says, 'Give them my email address, AND recommend they petition during my hours until a resolution or answer is heard'
[Mon Oct 22 18:27:30 2001] Lirus says, 'Many times I get emails about reimbursement but i still need to talk to them in game'
[Mon Oct 22 18:27:33 2001] Lirus says, 'for more information'
[Mon Oct 22 18:27:40 2001] Dalharil says, 'ok.. but *I* should not send you email .. that was my question.'
[Mon Oct 22 18:27:50 2001] Lirus says, 'so it's very important they know to petition as well as email'
[Mon Oct 22 18:27:54 2001] Lirus says, 'right'
[Mon Oct 22 18:27:58 2001] Lirus says, 'have the player do it'
[Mon Oct 22 18:28:32 2001] Dalharil says, 'Ok.. I just wanted to ask before I started spamming your email  '
[Mon Oct 22 18:28:34 2001] Dalharil grins evilly at Lirus.
[Mon Oct 22 18:28:38 2001] Lirus beams a smile at Dalharil.
[Mon Oct 22 18:28:54 2001] Rynara says, 'I also would l;ike to welcome Dratier to the team. He has transfered here from ummm what server was that?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:29:01 2001] Lirus says, 'Now that SOE-misc is gone i hardly have any heh, cept on Thursdays hehe'

[Mon Oct 22 18:29:40 2001] Dalharil Dalharil sniffs the air..
[Mon Oct 22 18:29:49 2001] Faelinn grosses out.
[Mon Oct 22 18:29:54 2001] Devynn says, 'When do we get to kill...errr...initiate Dratier?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:29:56 2001] Devynn grins evilly.
[Mon Oct 22 18:30:02 2001] Abbadabba says, 'lol'
[Mon Oct 22 18:30:07 2001] Lirus says, 'Anyone have any questions/ concerns/ things ye would like to bring up?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:30:18 2001] Abbadabba says, 'i have a Question /wink'

[Mon Oct 22 18:30:29 2001] Abbadabba says, 'can i spam your email?..'
[Mon Oct 22 18:30:29 2001] Nazbag says, 'I had one, but I'll wait and see how the new board works'
[Mon Oct 22 18:30:33 2001] Disden sways still feeling the beating he got earlier, then smiles at Dratier.
[Mon Oct 22 18:30:40 2001] Lirus says, 'Mmmm nope'
[Mon Oct 22 18:30:44 2001] Lirus bonks Abbadabba on the head!
[Mon Oct 22 18:30:44 2001] Abbadabba says, 'Dont listin to me anymore  hehe'

[Mon Oct 22 18:31:02 2001] Faelinn says, 'ahahahah'

[Mon Oct 22 18:31:05 2001] Dalharil says, 'have the pet email'
[Mon Oct 22 18:31:08 2001] Oraden faints.

[Mon Oct 22 18:31:35 2001] Lirus says, 'Yes dal?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:31:50 2001] Dalharil says, 'one that has been raised in teh past... and just doesn't seem to have a resolution handy'
[Mon Oct 22 18:32:11 2001] Dalharil says, 'and that is some form of Senior coverage on a regular basis in the mornings (USA mornings)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:32:20 2001] Cazza says, 'here here'
[Mon Oct 22 18:32:25 2001] Dalharil says, 'we have a very large european and asian player base on in the mornings'

[Mon Oct 22 18:32:40 2001] Dalharil says, 'and asking them to contact seniors and gm's during their working hours is not cutting it'

[Mon Oct 22 18:33:28 2001] Cazza says, 'so if you have filled the position.. and then we are trained wouldnt we automatically be moved.. '
[Mon Oct 22 18:33:39 2001] Oraden says, 'Aye, is it apropriate to attempt to add ALL the SWAT Seniors to ICQ lists? (Doubt they want 1600+ guides on their contacts lists.)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:33:46 2001] Abbadabba shrugs./..Psssst Voidaal over here ... sit over here.

[Mon Oct 22 18:34:45 2001] Swiftmoor says, 'remind me not to have her on a raid :)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:35:29 2001] Lirus says, 'I have as much knowledge on the matter as you do. All GM's got a 2 page questionaire, we were asked to answer in essay form in regards to our thoughts etc about customer service and what could be done to improve'
[Mon Oct 22 18:35:54 2001] Disden says, 'bet that was about as much fun as being hit with a brick'
[Mon Oct 22 18:35:56 2001] Lirus says, 'So our input is in and everyone is kinda waitin an watching for the bomb ta drop heh'

[Mon Oct 22 18:36:34 2001] Rahaven says, 'What we really, really need is a mechanism to contact other servers w/o camping'
[Mon Oct 22 18:36:41 2001] Aldorin says, 'thanks for helping me get it up the chain Rynara'
[Mon Oct 22 18:36:47 2001] Rynara says, 'my pleasure'
[Mon Oct 22 18:36:49 2001] Aldorin says, 'Rahaven you have that already IF you have a second PC'
[Mon Oct 22 18:37:02 2001] Rahaven says, 'Aye, which I can't always count on, unfortunately'
[Mon Oct 22 18:37:06 2001] Dalharil says, 'aye.. but many do not have that luxury'
[Mon Oct 22 18:37:11 2001] Lirus says, 'Any other questions? Feel free to speak yer mind and ask...'
[Mon Oct 22 18:37:15 2001] Kaweewee has a question.
[Mon Oct 22 18:37:15 2001] Aldorin says, 'you can log into Morell Thule *and* chat server simultaneously, if you didn't know... any of you..'
[Mon Oct 22 18:37:20 2001] Oraden raises his hand.
[Mon Oct 22 18:37:22 2001] Lirus says, 'Yes Kaweewee'
[Mon Oct 22 18:37:22 2001] Swiftmoor says, 'It is good to note that if you have a second computer you CAN log in with your guide account to go to chat'
[Mon Oct 22 18:37:24 2001] Rynara says, 'Kaweewee?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:38:10 2001] Kaweewee says, 'I know verant cant hire enough gm to cover all servers 24 hours a day but why cant 1 gm have 4 screens. Not to respond to common name changes and such but just in case of emergency things?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:38:24 2001] Lirus says, '4 computers?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:38:24 2001] Kaweewee is a slow sloppy typist.
[Mon Oct 22 18:38:33 2001] Kaweewee says, '4 screens to watch'
[Mon Oct 22 18:38:45 2001] Lirus says, 'Is not feasible from a business aspect'
[Mon Oct 22 18:38:54 2001] Kaweewee says, 'how so?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:38:56 2001] Aldorin says, 'how about you make it OK to let Guides use EQ Windows'
[Mon Oct 22 18:38:59 2001] The spirit leaves you.
[Mon Oct 22 18:39:04 2001] Aldorin says, 'then ppl with one computer can log into MT and Chat at same time'
[Mon Oct 22 18:39:05 2001] Lirus says, 'For one there are space limitations'
[Mon Oct 22 18:39:25 2001] Lirus says, 'I sit on a row with only so much room on the table top, my co workers also need their space to work'
[Mon Oct 22 18:39:37 2001] Lirus says, 'there is not enough room to fit us all in a room with 4 comps each'
[Mon Oct 22 18:39:45 2001] Swiftmoor says, 'I've been guiding and trying to talk to a chat GM at the same time, that's hard enough'
[Mon Oct 22 18:39:55 2001] Cazza says, 'I appaulogize..switched computers '
[Mon Oct 22 18:40:11 2001] Lirus says, 'I have a toll which allows me to use EQ in a window'
[Mon Oct 22 18:40:11 2001] Rahaven raises his hand.
[Mon Oct 22 18:40:23 2001] Lirus says, 'and can check my range of tools except going to chat without leaving game'
[Mon Oct 22 18:40:27 2001] Kaweewee says, 'im sorry, i just do the math of 10 a player times the amount of players and I know the high tech stuff costs to keep eq up and running but i just cant understand that verant couldnt do something better than the current situation'
[Mon Oct 22 18:40:51 2001] Lirus says, 'Fer chat i usually just log off real quick but there are times when i have to get violate and take over someone's comp and lookup chat'
[Mon Oct 22 18:41:34 2001] Rahaven says, 'Should be possible to put the equivalent of a chat term here at CS home'
[Mon Oct 22 18:41:46 2001] Lirus says, 'Well Kaw, I am not a business major but I do know the majority of GM's are paid hourly, many other employees payed salary, we have benefits, heck the servers themselves are well over a million dollars'
[Mon Oct 22 18:42:04 2001] Lirus says, 'the 10 dollars people pay pays for bandwidth and access to server'
[Mon Oct 22 18:42:18 2001] Lirus says, 'It does not cover cost to run the business on monthy fees alone'
[Mon Oct 22 18:42:43 2001] Lirus says, 'My computer will need to be upgraded shortly'
[Mon Oct 22 18:42:46 2001] Disden says, 'but what about the actual sales of the disks shouldn't that help with the costs?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:42:47 2001] Lirus says, 'to even run luclin'
[Mon Oct 22 18:42:58 2001] Rimedear says, 'Aye, I always thought the business model must be tight'
[Mon Oct 22 18:42:59 2001] Lirus says, 'thats another 300 dollars per GM to upgrade a videocard'
[Mon Oct 22 18:43:03 2001] Oraden says, 'Lirus is quite correct. The numbers show that EQ has recovered the development costs and pays the bills, but Brad and company didn't go by a fleet of new cars on the profits.'
[Mon Oct 22 18:43:08 2001] Kaweewee says, 'I know we as guides are volunteers but it seems every shift some player or another is upset about not being able to be helped. Guess im just venting there frustrations'
[Mon Oct 22 18:43:14 2001] Lirus says, 'not to mention more ram processor etc'
[Mon Oct 22 18:43:48 2001] Aldorin says, 'I would hope Sony can get VAIO systems at cost for you though :)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:43:56 2001] Lirus says, 'lol one would think...'
[Mon Oct 22 18:43:57 2001] Abbadabba says, 'If it makes you all feal better my comp is harc0re piece of crap.'
[Mon Oct 22 18:44:00 2001] Rimedear says, 'So if we all pitch in $200 we can get you a 2GHz P4?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:44:06 2001] Lirus says, 'Unfortunately it doesn't work dat way in da real world hehe_'
[Mon Oct 22 18:44:07 2001] Swiftmoor says, 'hehe'
[Mon Oct 22 18:44:17 2001] Espranza saved.
[Mon Oct 22 18:44:21 2001] Aldorin says, 'or pitch in $60 each and get you an AMD Athlon XP 1800+ which is faster anyway :)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:44:29 2001] Nazbag says, 'guys, the business model that sony uses is somewhat beyond the scope of the guide program, can we move on?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:44:35 2001] Swiftmoor says, 'Just like I'd love to get American Express to give me 0 25846340ntrest. That's not going to happen'
[Mon Oct 22 18:44:36 2001] Lirus agrees with Nazbag.
[Mon Oct 22 18:44:48 2001] Abbadabba Opens his trust fund for new computer..
[Mon Oct 22 18:44:55 2001] Lirus says, 'other questions? Oraden i believe ye were next?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:44:56 2001] Disden says, 'why 0 25846340nterest and not money for free?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:45:20 2001] Oraden says, 'aye, recently some friendly people I have met have become addicted to guide brew and sandwiches.'
[Mon Oct 22 18:45:42 2001] Oraden says, 'is it appropriate to handle "requests" for snacks if the que permits or is it favoritism?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:46:08 2001] Lirus says, 'Wean em off it'
[Mon Oct 22 18:46:14 2001] Cazza says, 'hahah'
[Mon Oct 22 18:46:19 2001] Savlyn chuckles.
[Mon Oct 22 18:46:20 2001] Lirus says, 'and if ye give stuff out make sure you give to everyone in da area'
[Mon Oct 22 18:46:30 2001] Rahaven says, 'They go cold gnome :)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:46:32 2001] Kezia says, 'Dont take snack requests ... we are not here to serve them food.'
[Mon Oct 22 18:46:33 2001] Aldorin says, 'so you have like a transdermal gnome sandwich patch they can use?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:46:46 2001] Faelinn says, 'haha'
[Mon Oct 22 18:46:47 2001] Rahaven raises his hand.
[Mon Oct 22 18:46:47 2001] Kezia says, 'they will get the idea wthat we favor them and thta is bad'
[Mon Oct 22 18:46:57 2001] Abbadabba shrugs you all are mean.
[Mon Oct 22 18:47:02 2001] Faelinn says, 'lol'
[Mon Oct 22 18:47:03 2001] Lirus says, 'hehe'
[Mon Oct 22 18:47:04 2001] Disden says, 'just show them how the sandwiches are made :o)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:47:10 2001] Oraden says, 'aye, wanted to remain friendly without becoming friends.'
[Mon Oct 22 18:47:14 2001] Abbadabba Ducks under the bush.
[Mon Oct 22 18:47:15 2001] Lirus says, 'I tend to give em out to players i cannot help'
[Mon Oct 22 18:47:17 2001] Aldorin says, 'just sell sandwiches to NPC merchants and let players buy them'
[Mon Oct 22 18:47:24 2001] Lirus says, 'makes em feel a *little* better'
[Mon Oct 22 18:47:37 2001] Nazbag has a question next.
[Mon Oct 22 18:47:37 2001] Devynn says, 'I've done that before Lirus'
[Mon Oct 22 18:47:56 2001] Lirus says, 'Other questions?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:48:01 2001] Rahaven raises his hand.
[Mon Oct 22 18:48:04 2001] Disden raises his hand also.
[Mon Oct 22 18:48:06 2001] Savlyn raises his hand.
[Mon Oct 22 18:48:06 2001] Lirus says, 'Yes Rahaven?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:48:35 2001] Rahaven says, 'Lirus, what's going to happen in december? I see we've had patchers before.. but will we need to be PC compliant to guide Luclin?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:48:58 2001] Lirus says, 'Yes you will need to be PC complient if you wish to venture there'
[Mon Oct 22 18:49:11 2001] Lirus says, 'Disden?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:49:28 2001] Lirus says, 'Naz i'll get ya in a sec'
[Mon Oct 22 18:49:32 2001] Savlyn says, 'you forgot Nazbag =)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:49:32 2001] Lirus says, 'SOrry bud'
[Mon Oct 22 18:49:33 2001] Disden says, 'Is luclin going to end up being like the planes and be a CS restricted zone?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:49:56 2001] Rynara says, 'all new zones are apprentice restricted if thats what you mean'
[Mon Oct 22 18:50:00 2001] Aldorin says, 'i sure hope the vah'shir newbie zones aren't gonna be CS restricted Disden :)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:50:03 2001] Lirus says, 'Perhaps for the first few weeks'
[Mon Oct 22 18:50:07 2001] Lirus says, 'or even months'
[Mon Oct 22 18:50:20 2001] Disden nods and smiles.
[Mon Oct 22 18:50:20 2001] Disden says, 'thanks'
[Mon Oct 22 18:50:23 2001] Lirus says, 'Appie restricted'
[Mon Oct 22 18:50:34 2001] Lirus says, 'Whatever they did with velious should be same fer luclin'
[Mon Oct 22 18:50:39 2001] Disden says, 'thats alright hopefully I won't be an appy by the time luclin comes out'
[Mon Oct 22 18:50:42 2001] Lirus says, 'Rynara or Kez feel free to comment'
[Mon Oct 22 18:50:48 2001] Lirus says, 'Nazbag?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:50:53 2001] Nazbag says, 'personally I have been in TOV more than all other CS limited zones combined, usually to summon stuck corpses, I always feel nervous when im taking action there, do you know if there are any plans to fix the zone?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:50:56 2001] Aldorin says, 'Velious has been out for 11 months now and it's still naked-person-offlimits'
[Mon Oct 22 18:51:01 2001] Kezia says, 'I have no comment until I speak with my lawyer =p'
[Mon Oct 22 18:51:06 2001] Swiftmoor attempts to raise his hand but Voidaal is sitting on it.
[Mon Oct 22 18:51:21 2001] Dalharil says, 'pssst... Voidaal... '
[Mon Oct 22 18:51:31 2001] Voidaal says, 'doh'
[Mon Oct 22 18:51:32 2001] Aldorin says, '... don't move ...'
[Mon Oct 22 18:51:32 2001] Dalharil says, 'Lift thy arse and move to the side... '
[Mon Oct 22 18:51:40 2001] Lirus says, 'No nazbag, due to the AE cast from mobs in there i do not know if there is a way to fix the geometry to prevent the corpses from falling into the walls'
[Mon Oct 22 18:51:57 2001] Lirus says, 'Development knows about it'
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:02 2001] Aldorin says, 'can you just make the walls less permeable in general?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:04 2001] Lirus says, 'Personally i would like to see Great Divide fixed'
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:09 2001] Oraden says, 'I had thought that Lirus once told me all the corpses stuck in ToV are the result of people trying to be close to the walls to avoid AE spells and being "knocked back" into them. '
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:09 2001] You agree with Mersi.
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:11 2001] You no longer have a target.
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:11 2001] Lirus says, 'as many people crash while zoning in'
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:13 2001] Devynn says, 'So they aren't so concerned with us popping in there so much?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:13 2001] Swiftmoor agrees with Lirus.
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:13 2001] Disden regards you indifferently -- You could probably win this fight.
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:13 2001] You are inspecting Disden.
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:15 2001] You no longer have a target.
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:15 2001] You no longer have a target.
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:15 2001] You no longer have a target.
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:16 2001] Rahaven says, 'mfff.. yeah, GD is murder'
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:18 2001] Nazbag says, 'in my experiance, we loose more rogues than anything else, fighting from the rear'
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:34 2001] Dalharil nods at Nazbag.
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:34 2001] Lirus says, 'Yes Oraden that is what usually happens...clerics and casters hide behind walls to avoid ae'
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:46 2001] Lirus says, 'and melees push mobs into walls'
[Mon Oct 22 18:52:59 2001] Lirus says, 'No devynn, yer there ta do yer job'
[Mon Oct 22 18:53:03 2001] Lirus says, 'It's not a big deal'
[Mon Oct 22 18:53:13 2001] Lirus says, 'as long as yer not goofing off ya have no worries'
[Mon Oct 22 18:53:14 2001] Kezia says, 'Just dont hang out there'
[Mon Oct 22 18:53:16 2001] Devynn says, 'Okies, I always feel nervous going in there :)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:53:18 2001] Rynara tells you, 'did you get your year medal last time?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:53:22 2001] Nazbag says, 'GD sucks, but at least players arn't getting stranded there, they just crash'
[Mon Oct 22 18:53:31 2001] Devynn says, 'hehe, I don't, get in, get out, get on with your life...hehe'
[Mon Oct 22 18:53:36 2001] Lirus says, 'hehe'
[Mon Oct 22 18:53:46 2001] Swiftmoor says, 'that and the ancient shardwurms that are constantly under the world there.'
[Mon Oct 22 18:53:53 2001] You told Rynara, 'for which? I have onluy 3 month medal'
[Mon Oct 22 18:53:54 2001] Nazbag says, 'we had one case where a guide went LD in TOV and started fighting a mob =( I have started asking the players if they are pulling before I go'
[Mon Oct 22 18:53:56 2001] Lirus says, 'They can summon if all else fails'
[Mon Oct 22 18:53:59 2001] Rynara tells you, 'ok'
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:12 2001] Lirus says, 'LOL yeah GM xzott did that before...ss went up on everlore lol'
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:14 2001] Faelinn says, '*sorry to interrupt but i need to log'
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:21 2001] Faelinn says, 'good night everyone :)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:22 2001] Lirus says, 'Np, Faelinn, have a good night'
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:22 2001] Espranza saved.
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:30 2001] Disden says, 'Bye Fae'
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:30 2001] Oraden says, 'Aye, I bugged that the other day, as GM Kiorran told me to bug and repeatedly "stuck" mobs in Velketor WW or GD.'
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:31 2001] Swiftmoor says, 'have a good night Fae'
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:32 2001] You say, 'later Fae!'
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:32 2001] Abbadabba says, 'Night'
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:36 2001] Voidaal says, 'night Fae'
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:39 2001] Dalharil turns a deeper shade of blue.
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:39 2001] Nazbag says, 'OK, CS limited nerves abated =)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:40 2001] Faelinn GMSAYS, 'zone'
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:41 2001] Rimedear waves goodbye to Faelinn.
[Mon Oct 22 18:54:43 2001] Faelinn fades away.
[Mon Oct 22 18:55:00 2001] Dratier says, 'Night Fae'
[Mon Oct 22 18:55:07 2001] Swiftmoor giggles at Dratier.
[Mon Oct 22 18:55:18 2001] Dratier says, 'Sorry, was getting a drink.'
[Mon Oct 22 18:55:40 2001] Disden raises his hand again.
[Mon Oct 22 18:55:51 2001] Aldorin says, 'ok if they're not gonna/ can't fix TOV, can we make it so that it's a slightly-less-CS-limited zone?  ie, Guides cannot EXPLORE there, but are authorized to unstick corpses without GM authorization?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:56:03 2001] You say, 'but you can'
[Mon Oct 22 18:56:06 2001] Oraden says, '??'
[Mon Oct 22 18:56:10 2001] You say, 'if nobody higher in rank is on'
[Mon Oct 22 18:56:21 2001] Aldorin says, 'if nobody higher in rank is on, you currently have to get chat GM auth'
[Mon Oct 22 18:56:21 2001] Devynn agrees with Espranza.
[Mon Oct 22 18:56:34 2001] Devynn says, 'No you don't. Not the way I understood it'
[Mon Oct 22 18:56:40 2001] Lirus says, 'And that will most likely stay that way for reasons outside of my control'
[Mon Oct 22 18:56:42 2001] Aldorin says, 'and a day without unsticking a corpse in TOV is like going to marie callender's and not getting pie'
[Mon Oct 22 18:56:49 2001] Dalharil says, 'I did not percieve it that way either'
[Mon Oct 22 18:57:01 2001] Kezia says, 'LOL'
[Mon Oct 22 18:57:06 2001] Aldorin says, 'there was a msg board thread about it, I believe Lirus said we DO need chat GM authorization to go to TOV'
[Mon Oct 22 18:57:20 2001] Cazza says, 'yes chat GM is what I understood'
[Mon Oct 22 18:57:23 2001] Lirus says, 'Seniors could you get a definite ruling on that?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:57:37 2001] Kezia says, 'ok'
[Mon Oct 22 18:57:37 2001] Aldorin hands Rynara and Kezia a ruler.
[Mon Oct 22 18:57:52 2001] Swiftmoor provides a gavel as well.
[Mon Oct 22 18:57:53 2001] Lirus stay away from me Kezia...i just got out of the pool it's not fair.
[Mon Oct 22 18:57:56 2001] Nazbag says, 'Im fairly sure that the PnP has a specific set of rules for "stuck in geometry" in CS limited'
[Mon Oct 22 18:57:56 2001] Abbadabba says, 'I belive that should go for the reason it takes forever to log all way out to simply say there is a stuck corpsew'
[Mon Oct 22 18:57:59 2001] Rynara says, 'if you have a pet there for say a cr you dont need chat auth'
[Mon Oct 22 18:58:10 2001] Kezia says, 'LOL'
[Mon Oct 22 18:58:14 2001] Abbadabba says, 'you already know they are gonna Auth it..'
[Mon Oct 22 18:58:16 2001] Kezia says, 'Shrinkage?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:58:16 2001] Nazbag says, 'that say nothing about authorization'
[Mon Oct 22 18:58:17 2001] Rynara says, 'you just need to document it and let the smt know'
[Mon Oct 22 18:58:22 2001] Lirus cringes away from Kezia.
[Mon Oct 22 18:58:29 2001] Mersi says, 'in your DSR =)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:58:37 2001] Aldorin says, 'ok Ryn that helps speed things up a bit'
[Mon Oct 22 18:58:44 2001] Abbadabba says, 'thanks'
[Mon Oct 22 18:59:11 2001] Aldorin looks at Lirus and raises his hand.
[Mon Oct 22 18:59:16 2001] Rynara says, 'I dont mean email us, just put it in your DSR'
[Mon Oct 22 18:59:19 2001] Rynara GMSAYS, 'ok'
[Mon Oct 22 18:59:29 2001] Rynara GMSAYS, 'misstell =)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:59:30 2001] Mersi says, 'Aldorin?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:59:32 2001] Oraden says, 'There was a discussion about this a month or so ago. Wasn't it decided that the Highest Ranking CSR had to do it or authorize a lower rank. (GM then Senior finally Guide?)'
[Mon Oct 22 18:59:43 2001] Aldorin says, 'I have a two part question.  1.  Will guides get horses, and 2.  Can mine be on fire?'
[Mon Oct 22 18:59:54 2001] Abbadabba says, 'lol'
[Mon Oct 22 18:59:58 2001] Lirus says, 'lol'
[Mon Oct 22 19:00:00 2001] Voidaal says, 'hehe'
[Mon Oct 22 19:00:01 2001] Kezia says, 'yes GM then Senior Then Guide ... but no guide has to ask the chat GM'
[Mon Oct 22 19:00:05 2001] Abbadabba says, 'i want a donkey ! !'
[Mon Oct 22 19:00:13 2001] Lirus says, 'i want a pony!'
[Mon Oct 22 19:00:15 2001] Disden says, 'I want a car'
[Mon Oct 22 19:00:17 2001] Lirus was JUST KIDDING!
[Mon Oct 22 19:00:19 2001] Kezia says, 'You want a flaming horse Al? You scare me'
[Mon Oct 22 19:00:19 2001] Mersi says, 'We don't know yet Aldorin... you will know as soon as we do'
[Mon Oct 22 19:00:23 2001] Abbadabba says, 'and a Kingdom for my donkey'
[Mon Oct 22 19:00:26 2001] Aldorin says, 'heh the GM of RL rode a donkey at least once :)'
[Mon Oct 22 19:00:28 2001] Rynara says, 'ok moving on'
[Mon Oct 22 19:00:46 2001] Disden raises his hand again.
[Mon Oct 22 19:00:52 2001] Abbadabba says, 'ok move on to Actaule meeting hehe'
[Mon Oct 22 19:01:01 2001] Abbadabba says, 'we ask to many Que's'
[Mon Oct 22 19:01:01 2001] Savlyn says, 'Would it be possible to have the Safe spot moved in a couple zones? ie..Stonebrunt and OOT in my opinion are way off base and I think cause more frustration then assistance'
[Mon Oct 22 19:01:08 2001] Aldorin says, 'SKYFIRE'
[Mon Oct 22 19:01:10 2001] Rynara says, 'let me apologive in advance if anyone is missed in their service medals, If so I will make sure you get it this week'
[Mon Oct 22 19:01:22 2001] Rynara says, 'and please excuse my typos'
[Mon Oct 22 19:01:32 2001] Rahaven says, 'Not to mention Sirens. the safe zone isn't safe at all'
[Mon Oct 22 19:01:37 2001] Abbadabba says, 'you handing out medels...'
[Mon Oct 22 19:01:43 2001] Rynara says, 'I am trying to'
[Mon Oct 22 19:01:44 2001] Aldorin says, 'yup there's a very pissed off bulthar that wanders through that safe spot'
[Mon Oct 22 19:01:46 2001] Abbadabba says, 'lol..'
