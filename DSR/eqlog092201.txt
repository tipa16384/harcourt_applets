[Sat Sep 22 15:41:32 2001] Mersi tells the guild, 'oh yes.. Lirus.. there is something wrong with HSK... something about his pet? Theo said it happened and needs fixing and I just remembered'
[Sat Sep 22 15:41:35 2001] You say to your guild, 'so still about fifteen minutes away'
[Sat Sep 22 15:41:52 2001] Lirus tells the guild, 'it's just annoying...doesn't hurt the game though'

[Sat Sep 22 15:42:22 2001] You tell your party, 'If you ever have any questions about guiding or whatever and a senior is not online, email them at MorellThuleSeniors@yahoogroups.com and let them know.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:42:34 2001] Yautja GMSAYS, 'would that affect whether an NPC will even spawn?'
[Sat Sep 22 15:42:38 2001] Lirus GMSAYS, 'no'
[Sat Sep 22 15:42:39 2001] Mersi tells the group, 'you should also email DSRs there until you get board access'

[Sat Sep 22 15:42:52 2001] You tell your party, 'The seniors are here to help you on your path to full guidehood.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:42:56 2001] Lirus GMSAYS, 'player just being impatient'
[Sat Sep 22 15:42:57 2001] The spirit leaves you.

[Sat Sep 22 15:43:29 2001] You tell your party, 'And remember, when sending email or whatnot, use your guide name, it's all we know you by.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:43:44 2001] Yautja GMSAYS, 'so Camin has a long spawn time?'

[Sat Sep 22 15:45:17 2001] Balaku tells the group, 'pass )'
[Sat Sep 22 15:45:19 2001] Mersi tells the group, '/sigh.. are you sure about those regulations, Esp? I thought there was a clause somewhere in there that said I could eat apprentices if I wanted'
[Sat Sep 22 15:45:23 2001] Espranza gives Abbadabba a slug.

[Sat Sep 22 15:46:13 2001] Balaku ducks behind Espranza.
[Sat Sep 22 15:46:16 2001] Espranza is crestfallen - she is not scary.

[Sat Sep 22 15:47:08 2001] Mersi says, 'I suppose we had best get back to regularily scheduled training'
[Sat Sep 22 15:47:52 2001] You tell your party, 'DO... ask questions as often as necessary. Keep in mind that we guides are asked to evaluate your performance, and often all we have to go on are your questions and chatter over /pr.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:48:21 2001] You tell your party, 'If you don't get an answer when you first ask, SHIFT-up arrow and ask again. Sometimes we miss the questions while zoning.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:48:35 2001] You tell your party, 'DO... explore the world as much as possible. Except those nasty off limits places.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:48:58 2001] You tell your party, 'DO... participate in answer circles. Players often have lots of questions or just would like to chat.'

[Sat Sep 22 15:49:56 2001] Yautja GMSAYS, 'Lirus that is'
[Sat Sep 22 15:50:13 2001] You tell your party, 'DON'T... handle exploit, abuse, harassment issues, or anything that requires an investigation - escalate those immediately to a full guide without contact.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:50:33 2001] Rynara GMSAYS, 'zone'
[Sat Sep 22 15:50:39 2001] Rynara fades away.
[Sat Sep 22 15:50:48 2001] You tell your party, 'DON'T... run, create, participate in or be any part of dynamic quests - this means both here, and on your home server.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:50:59 2001] Espranza saved.
[Sat Sep 22 15:51:00 2001] You say to your guild, 'I have to go AFK for about ten minutes after the DOs and DON'Ts.'

[Sat Sep 22 15:51:47 2001] You tell your party, 'It's not bad - just hang on a sec'
[Sat Sep 22 15:52:16 2001] You tell your party, 'If you find yourself in the same zone as a GM event on your play server, please leave the area ASAP. Even if this means changing where you are hunting that night.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:52:42 2001] Yautja GMSAYS, 'deleting Niinla'
[Sat Sep 22 15:52:57 2001] Yautja GMSAYS, 'Ssss.. I zone'
[Sat Sep 22 15:52:59 2001] You tell your party, 'Staying in the zone can be viewed as a guide leak. Participating or telling your friends about the quest IS a guide leak and will be subject to investigation and possible removal from the program.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:53:23 2001] Lirus GMSAYS, 'zone'
[Sat Sep 22 15:53:44 2001] You tell your party, 'This may sound terribly unfair, but once you hit full guide and start to participate in the wonderful quests our quest coordinators will run, you'll learn how much fun being on the other side of the NPCs are.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:53:56 2001] You tell your party, 'Most guides think the trade is more than fair.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:54:11 2001] You tell your party, 'Now, you can still participate in the invasion-style GM events on your play server.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:54:25 2001] You tell your party, 'There's no particular insider knowledge for those.'

[Sat Sep 22 15:55:11 2001] You tell your party, 'DON'T.... reprimand players (we have Guides for that) or Guides (we have seniors for that)'
[Sat Sep 22 15:55:31 2001] You tell your party, 'DON'T... speak for the guide program by posting in any public forum.'

[Sat Sep 22 15:56:15 2001] You tell your party, 'DON'T... give warnings to players, or suggest they will get one. If a customer is making you unhappy, pass the petition along to a full guide.'

[Sat Sep 22 15:58:10 2001] Rynara tells the guild, 'stop playing trains Lirus'
[Sat Sep 22 15:58:20 2001] You tell your party, 'Nor should you tell any player on Morell-Thule where you play or what your name is there. You CAN tell your fellow guides about where and what you play... it's fun finding friends on your play server.'
[Sat Sep 22 15:58:31 2001] You tell your party, 'I'm on Erollisi Marr - anyone else from there?'

[Sat Sep 22 15:59:48 2001] Agaden tells the group, 'tribunal here :)'
[Sat Sep 22 16:00:55 2001] You tell your party, 'And it's always important to remember that we are players, no different from the players here on MT... and in fact, some of the players here may be guides on other servers, so always treat everyone with the same respect you would show a senior or a GM her'
[Sat Sep 22 16:00:56 2001] Mersi tells the group, 'heh thats where a lot of people from my University city play'
[Sat Sep 22 16:00:57 2001] You tell your party, 'here.'
[Sat Sep 22 16:01:31 2001] You tell your party, 'DON'T... EVERY... hit another player, duel them, accept a duel, anything like that.'

[Sat Sep 22 16:05:14 2001] You tell your party, 'We *do* have a good time, and guiding is a lot of fun (for me anyway), but we must always remember that the customer and the petitions come first, and it is important to ALWAYS'

[Sat Sep 22 16:06:22 2001] You tell your party, 'If a player is getting to you, ask a guide to take over. There is no shame in asking another member of the tram to take over when a player is pushing your buttons.'
