He hit cancel, I did too, but like a sec after he did I'm pretty sure. Anyway, the stuff wasn't put back into my inventory. I had free spot so that's no the reason. It just disappeared. It was only about 400-500pp worth of gear, but I'm only lvl 9 and my other character is 25 so to me it's alot. So if you can get it back for me it would be gratly appreciated. TY
