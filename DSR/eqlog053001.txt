[Wed May 30 21:31:01 2001] You told Tairin, 'Hail, Tairin! Guide Espranza here. Has your problem with Rominh been resolved?'
[Wed May 30 21:31:19 2001] Tairin tells you, 'I'm not exactly sure -- he left the area but I don't feel he actually gets it yet.'
[Wed May 30 21:31:29 2001] You told Tairin, 'what happened?'
[Wed May 30 21:31:39 2001] Rominh tells you, 'okay thank you  :)'

[Wed May 30 21:32:04 2001] You told Rominh, 'Heh - I mean - be well!'
[Wed May 30 21:32:17 2001] Rominh tells you, 'hehe'
[Wed May 30 21:32:28 2001] Tairin tells you, 'Ok, I am waiting for Pyzjn to spawn -- She's a rare necro  that spawns at the ruins near the Surefall Glad.e'
[Wed May 30 21:32:53 2001] You told Tairin, 'yup'
[Wed May 30 21:32:58 2001] Tairin tells you, 'At any rate.'
[Wed May 30 21:33:19 2001] Tairin tells you, 'He had sent a shout out to the zone that said, "Camping the Ruins"'
[Wed May 30 21:33:28 2001] Tairin tells you, 'Which I assumed meant he was killing skeletons.'
[Wed May 30 21:33:34 2001] Tairin tells you, 'No big deal. '

[Wed May 30 21:34:06 2001] You told Tairin, 'ok'
[Wed May 30 21:34:08 2001] Tairin tells you, 'So he tells me to get out of his camp.'
[Wed May 30 21:34:27 2001] Tairin tells you, 'Which I simply tell him no and that I have every right to wait here just as he does.'
[Wed May 30 21:34:35 2001] You told Tairin, 'which is true'
[Wed May 30 21:34:36 2001] Tairin tells you, 'He tells me, "No, I was here first".'
[Wed May 30 21:34:52 2001] You told Tairin, 'which means he should probably get first crack at her'
[Wed May 30 21:35:01 2001] Tairin tells you, 'So I tell him, that if he wants to get technical -- I was there first, Iv'e been there since the patch was completed =)'
[Wed May 30 21:35:20 2001] Tairin tells you, 'He tells me , "No you weren't I can see invis dumbass"'
[Wed May 30 21:35:27 2001] You told Tairin, 'in which case you should :) he said you were nowhere around when he got there'
[Wed May 30 21:35:33 2001] Tairin tells you, 'I was sitting up on the hill when he shouted that he was camping the ruins.'
[Wed May 30 21:35:46 2001] Tairin tells you, 'Case in point, he began to get arrogant and annoying .'
[Wed May 30 21:36:00 2001] Espranza saved.
[Wed May 30 21:36:01 2001] Tairin tells you, 'I started logging the conversation from that point, I sent a report out and sent a petition as well.'
[Wed May 30 21:36:14 2001] Tairin tells you, 'I also told him he needs to check out the "Play Nice Policy" on the EQ website.'
[Wed May 30 21:36:24 2001] You told Tairin, 'okay, I will find a GM to look at the report in a few minutes'
[Wed May 30 21:36:29 2001] Tairin tells you, 'As far as "Cracks at" go, I think it's fair game.'
[Wed May 30 21:36:38 2001] Tairin tells you, 'There were others around this morning when I was hunting her.'
[Wed May 30 21:36:49 2001] You told Tairin, 'the policy is unclear on rare spawns like her'
[Wed May 30 21:37:01 2001] Tairin tells you, 'I feel that it's fair game, first find, first kill'
[Wed May 30 21:37:04 2001] Tairin tells you, 'as it was today with me.'
[Wed May 30 21:37:16 2001] Tairin tells you, 'I found her but someone else killed her before I could -- I was that the camp first, it jsut happens.'
[Wed May 30 21:37:25 2001] Tairin tells you, 'However, I did not appreciate being called a dumbass and such.'
[Wed May 30 21:37:35 2001] You told Tairin, 'I think that is fair, but -- if I came down, I would set an order'
[Wed May 30 21:37:41 2001] Tairin tells you, 'So I sent what I could (first 10 lines of text) and hopefully a GM can sort it out.'
[Wed May 30 21:37:45 2001] You told Tairin, 'so usually it's better if everyone just decides what to do'
[Wed May 30 21:37:53 2001] You told Tairin, 'yeah, I'll have a GM look at it.'
[Wed May 30 21:37:55 2001] Tairin tells you, 'Well technically, there can't be an order because she spawns so very little.'
[Wed May 30 21:38:14 2001] You told Tairin, 'I know, but the PNP mandates that that is what I have to do'
[Wed May 30 21:38:22 2001] Tairin tells you, 'But he was rude and arrogant and I just feel he needs dealt with however the GMs see fit.'
[Wed May 30 21:38:25 2001] You told Tairin, 'even though it doesn't make sense in the case of rare spawns'
[Wed May 30 21:38:29 2001] Tairin tells you, 'Right.'
[Wed May 30 21:38:51 2001] You told Tairin, 'okay, as soon as I clear the queue out I'll get a GM to look at it.'
[Wed May 30 21:38:51 2001] Tairin tells you, 'If everything gets technical, I have been waiting since early this afternoon (EST) -- I have those who can vouche if necessary.'
[Wed May 30 21:38:58 2001] Tairin tells you, 'Ok, thank you -- Have a nice day.'
[Wed May 30 21:39:01 2001] You told Rominh, 'you reported it under the name Rominh?'
