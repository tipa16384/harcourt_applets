[Tue Feb 26 18:10:07 2002] Sivy GMSAYS, 'doh'
[Tue Feb 26 18:10:31 2002] Cazza says, 'Guides zone frequently and may have missed your questions the first time.'
[Tue Feb 26 18:11:04 2002] You GMSAY, 'what was the question???'
[Tue Feb 26 18:11:17 2002] Cazza says, 'If the guides don't know the answer to a question, tell the customer that this is a new issue to us and that you will enter it into your Daily shift report /DSR to get further guidance.'
[Tue Feb 26 18:11:30 2002] Cazza says, 'Then post it and ask around.  You will be surprised what you can learn from other guides!'

[Tue Feb 26 18:13:13 2002] You tell your party, 'well, it's the queue'
[Tue Feb 26 18:13:24 2002] Cazza says, 'we use this to verify the existence and location of a player's corpse.  If you get a petition from a player saying they cannot find a corpse, use this command to find out if they have one or more and where it is'
[Tue Feb 26 18:13:25 2002] You tell your party, 'I think any full guide would know how to teach that...'
[Tue Feb 26 18:13:26 2002] Kedian tells the group, 'Queue? whats that?'
[Tue Feb 26 18:14:03 2002] Rynara tells the group, 'the Q is after the P =)'

[Tue Feb 26 18:14:22 2002] Cazza says, 'Apprentice Training  takes place in the form of mentoring.  A mentor is a person who groups with you and takes you through scenarios when the queue is low, as well as helps you with any questions online.'

[Tue Feb 26 18:14:55 2002] Rynara tells the group, 'did Lirus say there were any thing being given as a proze tonight?'
[Tue Feb 26 18:15:00 2002] Maia says, 'not yet'
