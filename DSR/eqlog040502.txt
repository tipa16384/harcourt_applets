[Fri Apr 05 09:19:18 2002] You tell your party, 'but I would rather you had a month or two of being a full guide under your flea collar just so you have a broader experience of guiding with which to share with new apprentices.'
[Fri Apr 05 09:19:19 2002] Kilm says, 'they are a wonderful opportunity to meet players and players to meet guides'
[Fri Apr 05 09:19:39 2002] Kilm says, 'Don't  explore any of the dugeons '

[Fri Apr 05 09:38:34 2002] You say, 'To those we add two (and two only) new commands, the most important of which is /pr'
[Fri Apr 05 09:39:01 2002] You say, '/pr is our customer service chat channel, we guides share it with GMs and other CS personnel that may visit our fair realm'
[Fri Apr 05 09:39:40 2002] Bowsnipper says, 'Does that work the same way as /gu for a guild'
[Fri Apr 05 09:39:50 2002] You say, 'Why is this tool so important? Because it is through /pr that you can ask questions, keep us all apprised as to what you are doing, ask questions, listen in on what others are doing, and asking questions.'
[Fri Apr 05 09:39:56 2002] You say, 'Yes, it is exactly the same.'

[Fri Apr 05 09:40:35 2002] You say, 'As it is through your chatter and comments on /pr that we will learn about you, and you about us.'
[Fri Apr 05 09:40:47 2002] You say, 'It is by far the most important tool you will have.'
[Fri Apr 05 09:41:02 2002] Bowsnipper says, 'will this channel be open at all times when I log on ? Or do I activate it ?'
[Fri Apr 05 09:41:06 2002] You say, 'The other command given you is /searchcorpse, abbreviated /sea most usually'
[Fri Apr 05 09:41:12 2002] You say, 'It's open all the time'
[Fri Apr 05 09:41:37 2002] You say, '/sea lets you list the corpses a person may have, and the zone or zones in which they lay.'
[Fri Apr 05 09:41:53 2002] Espranza saved.
[Fri Apr 05 09:41:57 2002] You say, 'When a petitioner says they have died or lost their corpse, it should be the first command you use.'
[Fri Apr 05 09:42:16 2002] You say, 'Information from that can be used to append to the petition if you need to escalate it to a full guide.'
[Fri Apr 05 09:42:26 2002] You say, 'Any questions on commands?'
[Fri Apr 05 09:42:43 2002] You say, 'There are other commands listed in the P&P, but only those two are allowed to you.'
[Fri Apr 05 09:42:54 2002] You say, 'Every guide command is logged....'
[Fri Apr 05 09:43:18 2002] Bowsnipper says, 'Do I have to have the person targeted? And I cannot summon them, correct ?'
[Fri Apr 05 09:43:30 2002] Bowsnipper says, 'The corpses I mean'
[Fri Apr 05 09:43:31 2002] You say, 'No, you need not have them targeted'
[Fri Apr 05 09:43:36 2002] You say, 'Nor the corpse.'
[Fri Apr 05 09:43:41 2002] Bowsnipper nods at Espranza.
[Fri Apr 05 09:43:47 2002] You say, 'The /summon command is not available to apprentices'
[Fri Apr 05 09:43:48 2002] Kilm says, '/sea is universal, no target needed..and guide+ is summon'
[Fri Apr 05 09:44:30 2002] You say, 'Okies..... well, the next thing we'll cover is the daily shift report.'
[Fri Apr 05 09:44:35 2002] You feel the spirit of Norrath enter you.
[Fri Apr 05 09:44:50 2002] Kilm tells the group, 'Esp, when we are done with this. I'd like a moment of your time please :D '

[Fri Apr 05 09:46:12 2002] You say, 'Now you must have gotten the password to the guide boards already... yes?'
[Fri Apr 05 09:46:17 2002] You no longer have a target.
[Fri Apr 05 09:46:18 2002] Calwen tells you, 'Hello, just a quick question : my game freeze for 1 second each time a message pop in my chat window, can you help me with that my friend ?'
[Fri Apr 05 09:46:23 2002] Bowsnipper says, 'aye'
[Fri Apr 05 09:46:32 2002] You told Calwen, 'please petition, thanks!'
[Fri Apr 05 09:46:32 2002] Calwen tells you, 'Sorry, I am A.F.K. (Away From Keyboard) right now.'
[Fri Apr 05 09:46:45 2002] You say, 'Have you had a chance to log into the guide boards?'
[Fri Apr 05 09:46:54 2002] Bowsnipper says, 'yes'
[Fri Apr 05 09:47:09 2002] You say, 'Cool...! Have you read any of the DSRs on the Morell-Thule boards?'
[Fri Apr 05 09:47:19 2002] Calwen tells you, 'thkx a lot'
[Fri Apr 05 09:47:29 2002] You told Calwen, 'you bet!'

[Fri Apr 05 09:48:37 2002] Kilm tells the group, 'nope '
[Fri Apr 05 09:48:51 2002] Kilm tells the group, 'you mean if theiir corpse is under the NPC ?'
[Fri Apr 05 09:48:52 2002] You tell your party, 'they'll have to wait until the NPC is gone.'
[Fri Apr 05 09:48:59 2002] You tell your party, 'have they tried the /corpse command?'
[Fri Apr 05 09:49:11 2002] Silae tells the group, 'no, if the NPC corpse is beyond reach...  an uber mob corpse...'

[Fri Apr 05 09:50:51 2002] You say, 'Click on that, and you'll see a list of names with messages (DSRs) posted beneath each one'
[Fri Apr 05 09:51:16 2002] You say, 'We seniors are first, then guides, then apprentices, and then finally NEW apprentices. Your name won't be there, because... you're new :)'
[Fri Apr 05 09:51:21 2002] Bowsnipper says, 'Aye, I looked at the schedules, very nice'
