[Wed Nov 13 08:47:31 2002] Welcome to EverQuest!
[Wed Nov 13 08:47:31 2002] You have entered Cabilis East.
[Wed Nov 13 08:47:31 2002] MESSAGE OF THE DAY: Greetings Norrathians!  The quests asking for the "Spectral Parchment" have random and sometimes repeated rewards.  This is an intentional part of the quest.  We appreciate all your feedback!
[Wed Nov 13 08:47:32 2002] GUILD MOTD: Denethir - Just a heads up about EQIM, instant messaging for EQ. Offline players can now message online players, offline players do not show on a /who all. Obviously there is a potential for abuse here. Online players can still /ignore the offline players though. See Cronn's post on the General Discussion board for more information.

[Wed Nov 13 09:52:17 2002] You have entered Cabilis East.
[Wed Nov 13 09:52:17 2002] MESSAGE OF THE DAY: Greetings Norrathians!  The quests asking for the "Spectral Parchment" have random and sometimes repeated rewards.  This is an intentional part of the quest.  We appreciate all your feedback!
[Wed Nov 13 09:52:18 2002] GUILD MOTD: Denethir - Just a heads up about EQIM, instant messaging for EQ. Offline players can now message online players, offline players do not show on a /who all. Obviously there is a potential for abuse here. Online players can still /ignore the offline players though. See Cronn's post on the General Discussion board for more information.
