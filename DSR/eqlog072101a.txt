[Sat Jul 21 16:36:57 2001] You say, 'and often all we have to go on are your questions and the chatter over /pr. If you don't get an answer when you first ask, ask again in a moment, we might have missed the question while zoning.'

[Sat Jul 21 16:39:32 2001] Rimedear says, 'I never saw many guides on Xegony.  I'll endeavor to be extremely visible'
[Sat Jul 21 16:40:01 2001] You say, 'Then you'll be a fine guide - I also try not to spend too much time here when guiding... unless I get pestered too much by players.'

[Sat Jul 21 16:41:36 2001] You say, '.... which leads to our next DON'T....!'
[Sat Jul 21 16:41:50 2001] Tankqer tells you, 'mob got bugged on me I could not target it and it somehow hit me through a wall'
[Sat Jul 21 16:42:01 2001] You say, 'Don't handle exploit, abuse, harassment issues or that sort. Just escalate them right away.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:42:14 2001] You told Tankqer, 'please petition - we'll be with you as soon as possible.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:42:46 2001] Rimedear says, 'Yes.  As an apprentice, I'm more like a watchdog than a cop.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:42:51 2001] You say, 'As an apprentice, you won't usually be investigating stuff anyway. But you should talk to the petitioners anyway to find out details, unless they are something that requires discretion.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:42:59 2001] Tankqer tells you, 'done'
[Sat Jul 21 16:43:04 2001] Rimedear says, 'Understood.'

[Sat Jul 21 16:43:59 2001] You say, 'DON'T run, create, or participate in dynamic quests - either here or on Xegony.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:44:22 2001] You say, 'Guides have privileged information on quests and it isn't fair to others for us to be involved.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:44:33 2001] Rimedear says, '??  oh, so the knowledge I gain now shouldn't be used by my play characters'
[Sat Jul 21 16:44:35 2001] You say, 'You'll have the opportunity to act in quests, which is much more fun.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:44:46 2001] You say, 'Not about quests anyway.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:44:59 2001] Rimedear says, 'Yes... understood'
[Sat Jul 21 16:45:06 2001] You say, 'And not about your activities as a guide - but we'll get to that in a moment.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:45:27 2001] Rimedear says, 'The ability to keep my mouth shut is obvious importance'
[Sat Jul 21 16:45:32 2001] You say, 'As an apprentice, you are not allowed to be in the zone where a quest is happening'
[Sat Jul 21 16:46:06 2001] You say, 'Neither here, nor on your play server... the exception is invasion type quests, where monsters attack everyone'
[Sat Jul 21 16:46:10 2001] Rimedear says, 'Sensible'
[Sat Jul 21 16:46:23 2001] You say, 'you can participate in those on your play server, since there are no secrets to reveal'
[Sat Jul 21 16:46:31 2001] You say, 'Still barred from even those here, though/'
[Sat Jul 21 16:46:55 2001] You say, 'DON'T... reprimand or speak ill of other guides. Or players for that matter.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:47:22 2001] You say, 'DON'T... speak for the guide program. When you're not logged in your guide avatar answering petitions, you aren't a guide.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:47:22 2001] Rimedear says, 'All negative energies must be disapated, check'
[Sat Jul 21 16:47:44 2001] You say, 'They have people to speak for the guide program, and we ain't them.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:47:45 2001] Espranza saved.
[Sat Jul 21 16:47:48 2001] Rimedear says, 'I am a sole member of an elite organization, not to speak for it'
[Sat Jul 21 16:47:56 2001] Rimedear says, 'check'
[Sat Jul 21 16:48:14 2001] Mersi finds a brick block on her table useful for punching and banging her head on is very useful when guiding =)
[Sat Jul 21 16:48:27 2001] You say, 'DON'T... give warnings to players. We full guides are a jealous sort and guard our ability to warn carefully.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:48:41 2001] You say, 'It's not a power you have, so don't threaten people with it.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:49:02 2001] Rimedear says, 'Don't waste words.  Check.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:49:10 2001] You say, 'If you feel a warning should be issued, talk it over with your mentor, who will investigate.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:49:41 2001] Rimedear says, 'That doesn't sound right, I'd escalate a petition if I felt he would be a future problem'
[Sat Jul 21 16:49:42 2001] You say, 'DON'T... tell anyone at all you are a guide. If I ask if you're a guide, think twice...!'

[Sat Jul 21 16:52:01 2001] You say, 'Do not duel anyone. If you want to fight another guide, we have an arena here to fight in.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:52:07 2001] Rimedear says, 'Yes'
[Sat Jul 21 16:52:10 2001] You say, 'never never never never fight a player.'

[Sat Jul 21 16:53:01 2001] You giggle at Mersi.
[Sat Jul 21 16:53:07 2001] You say, 'you can hit monsters.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:53:11 2001] Mersi hugs Espranza.
[Sat Jul 21 16:53:13 2001] You say, 'to reset them'
[Sat Jul 21 16:53:18 2001] You say, 'but not as an apprentice.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:53:24 2001] Rimedear says, '?? ah, but shouldn't I use /kill ?'
[Sat Jul 21 16:53:35 2001] Rimedear says, 'yes, only as a full guide'
[Sat Jul 21 16:53:38 2001] You say, 'sometimes you don't want them dead, just elsewhere'
[Sat Jul 21 16:53:41 2001] Mersi says, 'vendors and quest NPCs shouldn't be killed unless its unavoidable'
[Sat Jul 21 16:53:55 2001] You say, 'so you aggro them (I usually use cancel magic actually) and lead them home.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:54:01 2001] Mersi says, 'which is why some of us choose to whack and run )'
[Sat Jul 21 16:54:12 2001] Rimedear says, 'So get them to aggro and run them somewhere, something like that?'
[Sat Jul 21 16:54:18 2001] Rimedear says, 'Yes. ok'
[Sat Jul 21 16:54:28 2001] Mersi says, 'run them as close as you can to their proper position)'
[Sat Jul 21 16:54:29 2001] You say, 'yeah, we'll show you how to do that during your apprenticeship'
[Sat Jul 21 16:54:39 2001] You say, 'it's a trick, and fun, and you could die :)'

[Sat Jul 21 16:56:33 2001] You say, 'Roleplay as much as you like, and always be friendly. If someone is getting to you - escalate it to a guide.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:56:50 2001] You say, 'It is better to pass it along than to let it get to you.'
[Sat Jul 21 16:57:01 2001] Rimedear says, 'and my every action is visible and will leave memories in all who are affected'
[Sat Jul 21 16:57:03 2001] You say, 'And as a full guide, you can pass it along to a senior - like Mersi'
