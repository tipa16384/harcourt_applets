[Wed May 23 00:55:33 2001] You told Chrystian, 'Jaxus says he rezzed you for a server crash, not link death.'
[Wed May 23 00:55:40 2001] Jaxus says, 'why?'
[Wed May 23 00:56:00 2001] You say, 'Because he is insisting on a rez for what I described, saying you rezzed him for the same thing.'
[Wed May 23 00:56:14 2001] You say, 'Apparently not realizing I could ask you.'

[Wed May 23 00:58:12 2001] Nizzalno tells you, 'But can you give me like a rez or like move my corpse and get my exp there?'

[Wed May 23 00:58:29 2001] Jaxus says, 'I remember most of it'
[Wed May 23 00:59:01 2001] You told Nizzalno, 'No, I cannot do that. I'm sorry. Necromancers are hated in most cities - it is one of the challenges of playing one.'
[Wed May 23 00:59:22 2001] You say, 'Well, I denied him a rez for it. We don't rez for deaths caused by lag or link death.'
[Wed May 23 00:59:26 2001] Chrystian tells you, 'I WANT MY EXP BACK!'
[Wed May 23 00:59:53 2001] You told Chrystian, 'We don't rez for deaths caused by lag or link death. I am sorry. Perhaps you can find a cleric who can rez you?'
[Wed May 23 00:59:57 2001] Jaxus says, 'Aye, I know and have made alot of enemies because of it'
[Wed May 23 00:59:59 2001] Jaxus grins.
[Wed May 23 01:00:02 2001] Nizzalno tells you, 'Yes i agree but can you just take me to my corpse? I have checked and there are no Clerics high enogh here and i know you gms have the power to do it.....my 49 Druid friend had a Rez from you guys '
[Wed May 23 01:00:09 2001] You say, 'he's shouting at me now.'
[Wed May 23 01:00:24 2001] Chrystian tells you, 'that is not true beacuse this happend B4 and jaxus gave me a rez! its not my fault i died!  not my job to find a rez beacuse i died from a non game element! '
[Wed May 23 01:00:24 2001] Jaxus says, 'want me to talk to him?'
[Wed May 23 01:00:38 2001] You told Nizzalno, 'No, I cannot help you with CR, and although I have the power to rez, I cannot do it in this case.'
[Wed May 23 01:00:51 2001] Nizzalno tells you, 'why not?'

[Wed May 23 01:01:25 2001] You told Chrystian, 'Me? I didn't give you a rez for this. Jaxus is here with me and says the incident to which you refer was related to a server crash.'
[Wed May 23 01:01:52 2001] You told Nizzalno, 'Because we do not rez for things that are not bugs. It is intended that necromancers are unwelcome in most cities.'
[Wed May 23 01:02:44 2001] Nizzalno tells you, 'yes but it is kinda of hard for me to get my corpse back? And I thought you guys were supposed to make the game fun? well rihgt now iam not enjoying it'
[Wed May 23 01:02:49 2001] Jaxus says, 'Like I said the only reason he got one from me was because of the server acting up. And it was GM approved.'
[Wed May 23 01:02:52 2001] You say, 'Hi. I am a necromancer. I went wandering in Freeport and was killed. I demand a rez.'
[Wed May 23 01:03:10 2001] You say, 'I'm not going to go get a chat GM to rule on this one.'
[Wed May 23 01:03:29 2001] Zimok tells you, 'the pet thing is on the bitcher thing by bank right?'
[Wed May 23 01:03:35 2001] Jaxus says, 'Don't expect you to. The servers being fine today'
[Wed May 23 01:03:41 2001] Zimok tells you, 'er butcher'
[Wed May 23 01:03:44 2001] Chrystian tells you, 'what is the differance!   I WANT MY EXP BACK '
[Wed May 23 01:03:44 2001] You told Zimok, 'yes, I nudged your corpse out a little for you.'
[Wed May 23 01:04:05 2001] Jaxus comforts Espranza.
[Wed May 23 01:04:18 2001] Zimok tells you, 'u me new favorite GM hehehe =)'
[Wed May 23 01:04:29 2001] You told Chrystian, 'My role is not to make the game fun - that's for players. My role is to make sure people don't get stuck in walls, can find their corpses, and stuff like that.'
[Wed May 23 01:04:35 2001] Nizzalno tells you, 'Will you get in trouble if you gve me a rez? If so i dont see why'
[Wed May 23 01:04:41 2001] You told Zimok, 'heh...!'
[Wed May 23 01:05:22 2001] You told Nizzalno, 'I work within the rules they give me. This is one of them.'
[Wed May 23 01:05:23 2001] Zimok tells you, 'can you take corpse to grobb zone i got sow ill run to oggok to be safe and dont want this happenign agian'
[Wed May 23 01:05:42 2001] You told Zimok, 'It shouldn't happen if you're careful where you walk.'
[Wed May 23 01:05:55 2001] You told Zimok, 'I've done all I can. You should be safe enough.'
[Wed May 23 01:06:23 2001] Nizzalno tells you, 'So being one of the rules is saying "Hey lets have some Necro die when he didnt even know what the hell is going on and then not even give him like a tp or any thing"'
[Wed May 23 01:06:59 2001] Jaxus says, 'I don't get why people can't just loot their stuff and move on, I've done countless times.'
[Wed May 23 01:07:02 2001] You told Nizzalno, 'Put yourself in my shoes. And let's say me, a halfling, runs into Neriak, the dark elf city, and am killed. And I petition. Should a guide come over and rez me?'
[Wed May 23 01:07:26 2001] Chrystian tells you, 'what are you talking about?! ........... '
[Wed May 23 01:07:27 2001] Nizzalno tells you, 'In my opion Yes'
[Wed May 23 01:07:46 2001] You told Nizzalno, 'there we differ.'
[Wed May 23 01:07:55 2001] Jaxus's image shimmers.
[Wed May 23 01:07:57 2001] You told Nizzalno, 'learning the dangers of the game is part of the game.'
[Wed May 23 01:07:59 2001] Nizzalno tells you, 'Yes we are '
[Wed May 23 01:08:05 2001] Jaxus feels a bit dispelled.
[Wed May 23 01:08:15 2001] Chrystian tells you, 'there is no diffrence in my deaths i died beacue of the same reason..... '
[Wed May 23 01:08:16 2001] Nizzalno tells you, 'yes and having fun is also part of the game'
[Wed May 23 01:08:39 2001] You told Chrystian, 'You died because of a link death? We don't rez for deaths related to lag or link death.'
[Wed May 23 01:09:35 2001] You told Nizzalno, 'I certainly hope having fun is part of the game, but that's not my job. My job is to make sure bugs don't affect people badly. Your death is part of the design of the game. My job is not to second guess the game designers.'
[Wed May 23 01:10:01 2001] You say, 'I'm tired of arguing with these people.'
[Wed May 23 01:10:30 2001] Jaxus says, 'Maybe paying him a visit in person will chill him out'
[Wed May 23 01:10:37 2001] You say, 'If you get a tell or petition from Chrystian or Nizzalno...'
[Wed May 23 01:10:47 2001] Nizzalno tells you, 'So what you are saying is that part of the game is designed to piss some one off '
[Wed May 23 01:10:52 2001] You say, 'No, in these cases I think it will make them believe I am about to help them.'
[Wed May 23 01:11:03 2001] Jaxus says, 'ok'
[Wed May 23 01:11:09 2001] You told Nizzalno, 'No, part of the game is that necromancers are unwelcome in most cities'
[Wed May 23 01:11:10 2001] Espranza saved.
[Wed May 23 01:11:15 2001] Nizzalno tells you, 'So if I understand is that when playing the game i should get as pissed off as i can?'
[Wed May 23 01:11:33 2001] You told Nizzalno, 'No, playing a necromancer means you have to be very careful where you go'
