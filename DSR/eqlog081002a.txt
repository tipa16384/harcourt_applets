[Sat Aug 10 15:30:13 2002] You say, 'First, let me introduce myself - I am Senior Guide Espranza. Over two years ago, I sat on this very same patch of grass, nervous as anything, but excited to finally see what it was like to be a guide.'

[Sat Aug 10 16:01:47 2002] Huttan says, 'ahh ok.'
[Sat Aug 10 16:02:35 2002] You say, 'A noisy apprentice is one who gets noticed. And since it is the duty of the guides on Morell-Thule to evaluate your performance at the end of your apprenticeship, it just makes good sense to make sure they notice you.'
[Sat Aug 10 16:03:23 2002] You say, 'You will also use /pr to announce everything you do with a petition, such as checking it out, deleting it, escalating it to a full guide or a GM, or whatnot'
[Sat Aug 10 16:03:41 2002] You say, 'The second command is /searchcorpse, or simple /sea'
[Sat Aug 10 16:03:57 2002] You say, 'We use it to see how many corpses a player has, and where they are.'
[Sat Aug 10 16:04:16 2002] You say, 'This is invaluable if someone claims they lost their corpse and cannot find it.'
[Sat Aug 10 16:04:31 2002] You say, 'Any questions about either of those commands?'
[Sat Aug 10 16:04:54 2002] Huttan says, 'not yet, im sure playing with them a bit will probably help tho'
[Sat Aug 10 16:05:18 2002] You say, 'Well, just remember, help is only a /pr away.'
[Sat Aug 10 16:05:44 2002] You say, 'Now, your duties as an apprentice guide.'
[Sat Aug 10 16:05:45 2002] Huttan says, 'hehe. right now that gets me the message "that is not a valid command. please use /help"'
[Sat Aug 10 16:05:56 2002] You say, 'heh... you'll get it soon enough'
[Sat Aug 10 16:06:46 2002] You say, 'As an apprentice, your main job is to get comfortable with the queue, get to know your fellow guides, and explore the world and learn about the game.'
[Sat Aug 10 16:07:08 2002] You say, 'Since we're non-KOS to everything, we can go places we normally could not go.... it's fun to explore!'
[Sat Aug 10 16:07:36 2002] You say, 'Alas, you cannot explore dungeons quite yet, but once you are promoted to full guide, why, these are opened to you as well.'
[Sat Aug 10 16:07:44 2002] You say, 'Except the very highest level zones.'
[Sat Aug 10 16:07:56 2002] Huttan says, 'i can imagine. i remember the day my pally became non kos to the folks in chardok. i spent all day wandering around in there'
[Sat Aug 10 16:08:37 2002] You say, 'I've hunted far too much in Chardok... they tell me 3500 dead goblins in Droga will buy back that trust...'
