[Thu Oct 25 23:35:58 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'Earron is quite a character. He gets all kinds of travelers stopping by his inn for a drink or whatever other business. His patrons started telling stories of being mugged and harassed by these loathsome individuals in the very streets of our fair city. Of course, he was concerned. So he became a kind of advocate for this cause, ringing the [alarm] bell as it were. I admit, at first I did not believe the conspiracy.

He even got the famous wizard Al'Kabor to help him out by determining the nature of the strange items many of our citizens were finding. Getting that man to do anything not directly related to his research is not an easy thing to accomplish either. Needless to say, at that point I saw the truth and the Prime Healer forgive me for not seeing it sooner.

Of course, the Bloodsabers retaliated and using their incomplete research still managed to unleash the plague that was finally eradicated with the help of the Priests of Life and citizens like you. Though it was devastating in its own right, you must admit it is rather mild compared to what it might have been. I thank you for your interest. Perhaps you would be willing to [help] me?
