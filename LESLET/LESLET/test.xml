<paragraph heading="Lost in the Labyrinth">
Database Central for ARL is hidden within a maze of twisty little
passages, all alike. Those without a keen sense of direction may
find themselves wandering around until the batteries in their
rusty lantern die, then to be robbed by a nasty pirate or waylaid
by an axe-bearing dwarf, or even eaten by one of the unseen grues
that prowl the darkened halls.
</paragraph>

<paragraph>
Perseverance and luck bring the intrepid adventurer to the
row upon row of massive servers set in ranks and files in the
center of a cavern with a black river flowing through one end,
over which a blind ferryman will bring you for the price of
two coins.

<paragraph heading="Deliverance">
After passing tests and trials, the wary (and weary) visitor
is wholly unprepared for the calm whiteness of the ARL inner
sanctum. Shadowless light comes from the softly glowing walls
and soothing music from the ceilings as the noiseless Acolytes
of the Oracle move about on their unfathomable errands.
</paragraph>

<paragraph>
Each visitor faces the final task of presenting the Oracle with
their query. The Acolytes are eager to help each new petitioner
format their question correctly, deriving pleasure from the
welcome diversion from their changeless lives.

<page title="What We Learned">

<paragraph>
We have seen that the path between a user's query and the final
reply is not nearly as automatic and safe as the government-controlled
media would have
you believe. From the choices below, please select the most
correct statement.

No. Industry leaders would like the public to believe that
a distributed network can be queried via keywords and associations
without human intervention, but it just ain't so.
</ifselect>
</answer>

<answer>
... once sent, is given a random response drawn from a list
of oracular responses
written by ancient Gnostics in the second century of the Roman Empire.
<ifselect>
Sorry. However, this was the system used until the Gorxians
contacted academecian Charles Babbage and gave him the plans
to the Difference Engine which ushered in the new era.
</ifselect>
</answer>

<answer>
... is answered by a mysterious Oracle, a sentient biological computer
slowly gnawing its way toward the molten core of our planet.

<ifselect>
Correct. The Oracle is expected to reach the core in the year
2512, at which time massive vulcanism will shatter the Earth's
crust.
</ifselect>
</answer>

<answer>
... is a crime against nature. Students should be satisfied
with static web pages.

<ifselect>
While many might agree, this view went out with disco, leisure
suits, and layered hair. Welcome to the new millennium. 'Nuff said.
