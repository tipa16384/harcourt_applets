<li>Click on a button and choose a curve to investigate.</li>
<li>On the curve, choose a point P at x = -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, or 1.</li>
<li>Move your mouse over the graph and a line will appear;
click when you think you have found the tangent line at P. Zoom in on the
line to look more closely at P as you experiment trying to find the tangent.
What is your estimate for the slope of the tangent?
Experiment with other points and the other curves.
